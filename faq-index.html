<P>
GNU's C Library, version 2 is the latest GNU version of the core library
used to develop applications on Unix systems.  These pages provide information
for using glibc 2 on a Linux system.

<P>
A new mailing list is available for users having problems using glibc 2 on
Linux systems.  See the <A HREF="#6">Links</A> section for
more details.
<P>
There are a couple of new installation documents available now for alternate
ways of installing glibc.  See the
<A HREF="#4">Installing Glibc</A> section for their location.
<P>
The latest version of glibc is 2.0.5c.  You will need to download the
2.0.5 to 2.0.5c patch seperately and apply it to the 2.0.5 distribution
in order to get 2.0.5c.  Version 2.0.6 is currently in testing to fix a
few minor problems.  This will hopefully be the last release before the
version 2.1 release.  Version 2.1 will be the official stable release.
<P>
Red Hat 5.0 is glibc based (though libc5 programs can still be used).  The
Intel version was released December 1.
<P>
The latest 2.0 development version of the Debian distribution (hamm) uses
glibc 2 as its primary libc.  Most of the development tools use glibc,
and by release, most if not all packages will be compiled with glibc.

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="2">What is Glibc 2</A></H2></CENTER>
<P>
Glibc 2 is the latest version of the GNU C Library.  (A C library is a set
of routines used to develop C programs.  Pretty much every program on your
Linux system uses the C library.)  It currently runs unmodified on GNU Hurd
systems, and Linux i386, m68k, and alpha systems.  Ports to Linux PowerPC,
MIPS, and Sparc are actively being developed.  In the future support for
other architectures and operating systems will be added.  On Linux, glibc 2
is used as the libc with major version 6, the successor of the Linux libc 5. 
<P>
Glibc 2 is titled "experimental."  It is not yet ready for general use,
but should be fairly stable.  As of 2.0.4, people have been using this
exculsively with no problems.  Version 2.1 will be ready for main stream
use.

<P>
<CENTER><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=0 WIDTH=90%><TR><TD>
<DL>
<DT><B>Thread safe</B>
  <DD>Glibc is now thread safe.  Functions with interfaces which prohibit
      a thread safe design (such as strtok) have been reimplemented with a
      reentrant counterpart.  The stdio implementation in this version has
      been rewritten to be really thread safe, not wrapped in locks as the
      libc 5 has been.
<P>
<DT><B>Better scheme for handing name databases</B>
  <DD>The name lookup code has been rewritten to provide a clean and
      extensible way of handling different schemes.
<P>
<DT><B>The math library has been improved</B>
  <DD>The library should be more correct and faster for some functions.
<P>
<DT><B>New functions from POSIX and XPG4.2</B>
  <DD>Several new functions from these standards have been added, and
      some existing functions have been improved to be closer to standards.
<P>
<DT><B>Stable interface</B>
  <DD>This library has been designed so a new incompatible libc interface
      should not be needed in the future.
<P>
<DT><B>Reduced dependency on kernel header files</B>
  <DD>The kernel header files are almost never used for libc.  This allows
      more flexible changes in the kernel headers without breaking things.
<P>
<DT><B>Trackable bug report mechanism</B>
  <DD>Glibc uses GNATS for tracking bugs in the library.  A glibcbug script
      included in the library distribution provides an interface for 
      reporting new bugs.  Users can watch the bug database using the
      www GNATS interface at
      <A HREF="http://www-gnats.gnu.org:8080/cgi-bin/wwwgnats.pl">
      http://www-gnats.gnu.org:8080/cgi-bin/wwwgnats.pl</A>
<P>
<DT><B>Header files and name space is clean</B>
  <DD>The header files and the name space are now clean.  This is
      necessary to be compliant with the various standards.
<P>
<DT><B>One source tree</B>
  <DD>The same source tree with only a handful of individual files is used
      for the ports to i386, m68k, alpha, mips, sparc, and ppc (perhaps some
      day soon even arm).
<P>
<DT><B>64-bit clean</B>
  <DD>Glibc has been improved to take better advantage of the 64-bit Alpha
      architecture.

<P>
There are now several documents describing how to install glibc 2 on
your system.  The <A HREF="Glibc2-HOWTO.html">Glibc 2 HOWTO</A> describes
how to upgrade your system using glibc as a your main C library or just
as a secondary (test) library.  The Glibc 2 HOWTO is now part of the
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP">Linux Documentation Project</A>.
<P>
Frodo Looijaard's <A HREF="http://huizen.dds.nl/~frodol/glibc/">
Installing glibc-2 on Linux</A> gives an alternate method for installing
glibc as a secondary library.  This installation takes longer, but
allows you to switch which libc you compile with very easily.
<P>
If you are using a Debian 1.3 system, the
<A HREF="http://www.gate.net/~storm/FAQ/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html">
Debian libc5 to libc6 Mini-HOWTO</A> will help you install glibc using
Debian packages.
