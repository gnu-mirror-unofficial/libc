<P>
<B>Note:</B>
Past GNU C Library releases have included a script called
<tt>glibcbug</tt>, which used to be the preferred way to report bugs.
<BR>Using the <tt>glibcbug</tt> script is <i>no longer supported</i>.<BR>
Please read on for current information on reporting <tt>glibc</tt> bugs.
</P>

<P>
Most users do not compile the GNU C Library from the sources released by
the GNU developers.  Most people are using <tt>glibc</tt> binaries supplied
with a complete operating system distribution from a project such as
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> or
<A HREF="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</A> (among many others).
Distributions such as these include their own modifications to
<tt>glibc</tt> in the binaries and sources you get with the operating system.

If the <tt>glibc</tt> you are using comes from a complete operating system
distribution, you should report bugs to that distribution project first.
Your distribution's own documentation and web pages should refer you to
their bug-reporting system.  Your distribution's maintainers will determine
whether the problem is specific to their modifications or other details of
that particular system.  If the problem does exist in the standard GNU C
Library code, they will report it to the GNU maintainers or direct you how
to do so.
</P>

    <P>
GNU C Library bugs are now tracked using the system at
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/">
http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/</A>.
Follow that link for details on using the system.
</P>

<P>
It's always best to query the database for similar-sounding bugs before
filing a new bug report.  If you find a report that clearly matches the
problem you have experienced, then don't enter a new report.  If you have
additional information to supply, you can add your comments to the existing
bug report.  If you want to be notified when new information is available,
add yourself to the bug's CC list.
If your problem seems different from one
you found, but you're not sure, it doesn't hurt to file a new report--but
be sure to mention the number of the bug report you think might be related.
If your report turns out to be a duplicate of an existing one, we can mark
it that way in the system.
    </P>
    <P>
If your problem is not already addressed by an existing bug report, you can
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=glibc">
enter a new bug report here</A>.
