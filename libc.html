    <P>

    <P>

    <P>
      Any Unix-like operating system needs a C library: the library which
      defines the ``system calls'' and other basic facilities such as
      open, malloc, printf, exit...

    <P>
      The GNU C library is used as <EM>the</EM> C library in the GNU system
      and most newer systems with the Linux kernel.

    <P>
      The history of Unix and various standards determine much of the
      interface of the C library.  In general the GNU C library supports the
      ISO C and POSIX standards.  We also try to support the features of
      popular Unix variants (including BSD and System V) when those do not
      conflict with the standards.  Different compatibility modes
      (selectable when you compile an application) allow the peaceful
      coexistence of compatibility support for different varieties of Unix.

    <P>
      Today the GNU C library should be almost complete: nearly all
      known and useful functions from any other C library are
      available.  However, there is still room for improvement.  If
      you would like to add or improve features in the GNU C library,
      please look through the list of <A NAME="TOCOpenTasks"
      HREF="#OpenTasks">open tasks</A>, then coordinate your work
      with the maintainers 
      <A HREF="mailto:bug-glibc@gnu.org">&lt;bug-glibc@gnu.org&gt;</A>.

    <P>
      The GNU C library is designed to be portable.  Although the
      library sources are very complex, you can build it for any
      supported system with the simple commands <CODE>configure</CODE>
      &amp; <CODE>make</CODE> --- provided your platform is supported!

    <P>
      The GNU C library manual is incomplete.  It would be
      very helpful if you could spend a bit of your time on writing
      the missing parts.  Please coordinate your work with the
      maintainers 
      <A HREF="mailto:bug-glibc@gnu.org">&lt;bug-glibc@gnu.org&gt;</A>.

    <P>
      We also have a page describing the 
      <a href="/software/libc/CONFORMANCE">conformance</a> with
      various standards.  This list also shows where GNU libc needs to
      be improved.

    <P>
      For more information on porting and the status of ports for
      Version 2, see <A HREF="/software/libc/porting.html">Porting the
      GNU C Library</A>.  If you are interested in porting GNU libc to
      additional system types, please contact the maintainers 
      <A HREF="mailto:bug-glibc@gnu.org">&lt;bug-glibc@gnu.org&gt;</A>.

    <P>
    There are some more mailing lists: libc-hacker is the private
    mailing list of the developers, <A
    HREF="mailto:libc-alpha@sources.redhat.com">libc-alpha@sources.redhat.com</A>
    discusses some development issues and carries announcements about
    alpha quality releases.  Mailing list subscription information,
    archives of all lists and the CVS archive can be found at <A
    HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/glibc">http://sources.redhat.com/glibc</A>.


    <P>
    <H4><A HREF="#TOCCurrentStatus" NAME="CurrentStatus">Current Status</A></H4>
    <P>

    <P>
      The current version is <A
      HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glibc/glibc-2.2.5.tar.gz">2.2.5</A>.
      The new major version number reflects major changes, several
      years of work.  1.09.1 was a static library in the style of the
      80s; the new version implements the state of the art in C
      library technology.  It follows even the most recent standards
      (ISO C 99, POSIX.1c, POSIX.1j, POSIX.1d, Unix98).  It is also
      internationalized and might have the most complete
      internationalization interface known.

    <P>
      See the <A HREF="/software/libc/NEWS">NEWS</A> file for more information.

    <P>
      Version 2 is built as a shared library --- in fact, multiple
      shared libraries.  Several parts of the library are separated
      out and are dynamically linked into the process when needed.

    <P>
      There is a <A HREF="/software/libc/FAQ.html">FAQ</A> which
      you should read first.



    <P>
    <H4><A HREF="#TOCAvailability" NAME="Availability">Availability</A></H4>
    <P>
      
    <P>
      The releases are available at <A
      HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc/</A>
      and its mirrors.  In the same directory there are probably
      several additional packages which can be used with the GNU libc.
      These are distributed separately either because of legal
      problems or because they are maintained by people outside the
      GNU libc developers group.

    <P>
      At the moment there are three add-on packages available:

    <UL>
      <LI>
	A <CODE>clone</CODE> based <EM>thread library</EM>.  This is
	currently only usable for the supported GNU/Linux systems.
	You'll find this in the <CODE>glibc-linuxthreads</CODE>
	add-on.</LI>

      <LI>
        The Berkeley DB NSS module, which has been an integral part of
	previous C Library versions, is now separately available as
	the <CODE>nss-db</CODE> module.</LI>
      <LI>

	The <CODE>nss-lwres</CODE> module is meant to support the lightweight
	resolver in BIND 9 when running on systems that use glibc.</LI>
     </UL>

    <P>
      Please consult the <A HREF="/software/libc/FAQ.html">FAQ</a> to
      find out how to handle add-ons.  The previously available
      <EM>locale data</EM> add-on is now an integral part of the GNU
      libc itself.  Fortunately, the U.S. Exports Regulations have
      been relaxed and so the <EM>DES cryptographic functions</EM> are
      now also part of the base GNU C library distribution!


    <P>
    <H4><A HREF="#TOCSupported Systems" NAME="Supported Systems">Supported Systems</A></H4>
    <P>

    <P>
      Version 2 currently supports only GNU systems --- both
      Hurd-based and Linux-based GNU systems.  Version 1.09.1
      supported many more systems; we hope that version 2 will be
      ported to them.  For more information on porting and the status
      of ports, see <A HREF="/software/libc/porting.html">Porting the
      GNU C Library</A>.

    <P>
      This list is not the most up-to-date list of pending tasks.
      Consult the file <CODE>PROJECTS</CODE> in the GNU C library
      distribution for most recent changes.

    <P>
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Write a more complete test suite.
      <LI>
	Port the GNU C library version 2 to currently unsupported
	systems.  See <A HREF="/software/libc/porting.html">Porting
	the GNU C Library.</A>
      <LI>
	The messages in the GNU C library are currently translated
	from American English into Brazilian Portuguese, British
	English, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, Galician,
	German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish,
	Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.
	Volunteers for other languages should contact the GNU
	translation manager <A
	HREF="mailto:gnu-translation@gnu.org">&lt;gnu-translation@gnu.org&gt;</A>.
      <LI>
	Some of the <CODE>long double</CODE> math functions are still
	missing.  We need advice from people having good knowledge of
	numeric mathematics.
      <LI>
	Currently there are fast, optimized assembler versions for the
	string and memory handling functions for ix86, Alpha, and MIPS
	processors.  Contributions for other architectures are
	welcome.
      <LI>
	The regular expression matching functions need to be
	extended/rewritten for full internationalization support.
	This includes support for character and collation classes.
	Wide character versions are also necessary.

      The GNU C Library Steering Committee
      <a href="mailto:glibc-sc@gnu.org">&lt;glibc-sc@gnu.org&gt;</a>,
      formed in 2001, is the governance body and has overall
      responsibility and charge for the maintenance of the GNU
      C Library as part of the GNU project.
      The committee currently consists of Mark Brown, Paul Eggert,
      Andreas Jaeger, Jakub Jelinek, Roland McGrath and Andreas Schwab.

    <p>
      The GNU C library was originally written
      primarily by Roland McGrath <A
      HREF="mailto:roland@gnu.org">&lt;roland@gnu.org&gt;</A> when he
      worked for the FSF.  During the development of version 2, Ulrich
      Drepper <A HREF="mailto:drepper@redhat.com">&lt;drepper@redhat.com&gt;</A>
      volunteered his efforts and became the foremost contributor.

      <p>
      Many others have contributed in large amounts.

    <P>
      The support for the GNU Hurd was partly written by Thomas
      Bushnell, n/BSG 
      <A HREF="mailto:thomas@gnu.org">&lt;thomas@gnu.org&gt;</A> and
      Miles Bader 
      <A HREF="mailto:miles@gnu.org">&lt;miles@gnu.org&gt;</A>.  The
      port for GNU/Linux on the m68k was done and is maintained by
      Andreas Schwab 
      <A HREF="mailto:schwab@suse.de">&lt;schwab@suse.de&gt;</A>,
      the port for GNU/Linux on the Alpha is due to Richard Henderson
      <A HREF="mailto:rth@tamu.edu">&lt;rth@cygnus.com&gt;</A> and
      David Mosberger-Tang 
      <A HREF="mailto:David.Mosberger@acm.org">&lt;David.Mosberger@acm.org&gt;</A>.
