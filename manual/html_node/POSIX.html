<h4>POSIX (The Portable Operating System Interface)</h4>

<p>The GNU library is also compatible with the ISO <dfn>POSIX</dfn> family of
standards, known more formally as the <dfn>Portable Operating System
Interface for Computer Environments</dfn> (ISO/IEC 9945).  They were also
published as ANSI/IEEE Std 1003.  POSIX is derived mostly from various
versions of the Unix operating system.

<p>The library facilities specified by the POSIX standards are a superset
of those required by ISO&nbsp;C; POSIX specifies additional features for
ISO&nbsp;C functions, as well as specifying new additional functions.  In
general, the additional requirements and functionality defined by the
POSIX standards are aimed at providing lower-level support for a
particular kind of operating system environment, rather than general
programming language support which can run in many diverse operating
system environments.

<p>The GNU C library implements all of the functions specified in
<cite>ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996, the POSIX System Application Program
Interface</cite>, commonly referred to as POSIX.1.  The primary extensions to
the ISO&nbsp;C facilities specified by this standard include file system
interface primitives (see <a href="File-System-Interface.html#File%20System%20Interface">File System Interface</a>), device-specific
terminal control functions (see <a href="Low-Level-Terminal-Interface.html#Low-Level%20Terminal%20Interface">Low-Level Terminal Interface</a>), and
process control functions (see <a href="Processes.html#Processes">Processes</a>).

<p>Some facilities from <cite>ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993, the POSIX Shell and
Utilities standard</cite> (POSIX.2) are also implemented in the GNU library. 
These include utilities for dealing with regular expressions and other
pattern matching facilities (see <a href="Pattern-Matching.html#Pattern%20Matching">Pattern Matching</a>).
