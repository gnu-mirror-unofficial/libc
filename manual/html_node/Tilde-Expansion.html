<h4>Details of Tilde Expansion</h4>

<p>It's a standard part of shell syntax that you can use <code>~</code> at the
beginning of a file name to stand for your own home directory.  You
can use <code>~<var>user</var></code> to stand for <var>user</var>'s home directory.

<p><dfn>Tilde expansion</dfn> is the process of converting these abbreviations
to the directory names that they stand for.

<p>Tilde expansion applies to the <code>~</code> plus all following characters up
to whitespace or a slash.  It takes place only at the beginning of a
word, and only if none of the characters to be transformed is quoted in
any way.

<p>Plain <code>~</code> uses the value of the environment variable <code>HOME</code>
as the proper home directory name.  <code>~</code> followed by a user name
uses <code>getpwname</code> to look up that user in the user database, and
uses whatever directory is recorded there.  Thus, <code>~</code> followed
by your own name can give different results from plain <code>~</code>, if
the value of <code>HOME</code> is not really your home directory.
