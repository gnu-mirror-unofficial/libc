<h3>Communication Styles</h3>

<p>The GNU library includes support for several different kinds of sockets,
each with different characteristics.  This section describes the
supported socket types.  The symbolic constants listed here are
defined in <code>sys/socket.h</code>.

<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
The <code>SOCK_STREAM</code> style is like a pipe (see <a href="Pipes-and-FIFOs.html#Pipes%20and%20FIFOs">Pipes and FIFOs</a>). 
It operates over a connection with a particular remote socket and
transmits data reliably as a stream of bytes.

<p>Use of this style is covered in detail in <a href="Connections.html#Connections">Connections</a>.

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left">int <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b><i>
</i></td>
<td align="right">Macro</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
The <code>SOCK_DGRAM</code> style is used for sending
individually-addressed packets unreliably. 
It is the diametrical opposite of <code>SOCK_STREAM</code>.

<p>Each time you write data to a socket of this kind, that data becomes
one packet.  Since <code>SOCK_DGRAM</code> sockets do not have connections,
you must specify the recipient address with each packet.

<p>The only guarantee that the system makes about your requests to
transmit data is that it will try its best to deliver each packet you
send.  It may succeed with the sixth packet after failing with the
fourth and fifth packets; the seventh packet may arrive before the
sixth, and may arrive a second time after the sixth.

<p>The typical use for <code>SOCK_DGRAM</code> is in situations where it is
acceptable to simply re-send a packet if no response is seen in a
reasonable amount of time.

<p>See <a href="Datagrams.html#Datagrams">Datagrams</a>, for detailed information about how to use datagram
sockets.
