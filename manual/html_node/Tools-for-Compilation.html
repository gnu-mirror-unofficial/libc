<h3 class="appendixsec">Recommended Tools for Compilation</h3>

<p>We recommend installing the following GNU tools before attempting to
build the GNU C library:

     <ul>
<li>GNU <code>make</code> 3.79 or newer

     <p>You need the latest version of GNU <code>make</code>.  Modifying the GNU C
Library to work with other <code>make</code> programs would be so difficult that
we recommend you port GNU <code>make</code> instead.  <strong>Really.</strong>  We
recommend GNU <code>make</code> version 3.79.  All earlier versions have severe
bugs or lack features.

     </p><li>GCC 3.2 or newer

     <p>The GNU C library can only be compiled with the GNU C compiler family. 
As of the 2.3 release, GCC 3.2 or higher is required.  As of this
writing, GCC 3.2 is the compiler we advise to use.

     <p>You can use whatever compiler you like to compile programs that use GNU
libc, but be aware that both GCC 2.7 and 2.8 have bugs in their
floating-point support that may be triggered by the math library.

     <p>Check the FAQ for any special compiler issues on particular platforms.

     </p><li>GNU <code>binutils</code> 2.13 or later

     <p>You must use GNU <code>binutils</code> (as and ld) to build the GNU C library. 
No other assembler or linker has the necessary functionality at the
moment.

     </p><li>GNU <code>texinfo</code> 3.12f

     <p>To correctly translate and install the Texinfo documentation you need
this version of the <code>texinfo</code> package.  Earlier versions do not
understand all the tags used in the document, and the installation
mechanism for the info files is not present or works differently.

     </p><li>GNU <code>awk</code> 3.0, or some other POSIX awk

     <p><code>Awk</code> is used in several places to generate files.  The scripts
should work with any POSIX-compliant <code>awk</code> implementation;
<code>gawk</code> 3.0 and <code>mawk</code> 1.3 are known to work.

     <li>Perl 5

     <p>Perl is not required, but it is used if present to test the
installation.  We may decide to use it elsewhere in the future.

     </p><li>GNU <code>sed</code> 3.02 or newer

     <p><code>Sed</code> is used in several places to generate files.  Most scripts work
with any version of <code>sed</code>.  The known exception is the script
<code>po2test.sed</code> in the <code>intl</code> subdirectory which is used to
generate <code>msgs.h</code> for the test suite.  This script works correctly
only with GNU <code>sed</code> 3.02.  If you like to run the test suite, you
should definitely upgrade <code>sed</code>.

   </ul>

<p>If you change any of the <code>configure.in</code> files you will also need

     <ul>
<li>GNU <code>autoconf</code> 2.53 or higher
</ul>

<p>and if you change any of the message translation files you will need

     <ul>
<li>GNU <code>gettext</code> 0.10.36 or later
</ul>

<p>You may also need these packages if you upgrade your source tree using
patches, although we try to avoid this.
