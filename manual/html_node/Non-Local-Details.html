<h3>Details of Non-Local Exits</h3>

<p>Here are the details on the functions and data structures used for
performing non-local exits.  These facilities are declared in
<code>setjmp.h</code>.

<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left"><b>jmp_buf</b><i>
</i></td>
<td align="right">Data Type</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
Objects of type <code>jmp_buf</code> hold the state information to
be restored by a non-local exit.  The contents of a <code>jmp_buf</code>
identify a specific place to return to. 
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left">int <b>setjmp</b><i> (jmp_buf <var>state</var>)
</i></td>
<td align="right">Macro</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
When called normally, <code>setjmp</code> stores information about the
execution state of the program in <var>state</var> and returns zero.  If
<code>longjmp</code> is later used to perform a non-local exit to this
<var>state</var>, <code>setjmp</code> returns a nonzero value. 
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left">void <b>longjmp</b><i> (jmp_buf <var>state</var>, int <var>value</var>)
</i></td>
<td align="right">Function</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
This function restores current execution to the state saved in
<var>state</var>, and continues execution from the call to <code>setjmp</code> that
established that return point.  Returning from <code>setjmp</code> by means of
<code>longjmp</code> returns the <var>value</var> argument that was passed to
<code>longjmp</code>, rather than <code>0</code>.  (But if <var>value</var> is given as
<code>0</code>, <code>setjmp</code> returns <code>1</code>). 
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There are a lot of obscure but important restrictions on the use of
<code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>.  Most of these restrictions are
present because non-local exits require a fair amount of magic on the
part of the C compiler and can interact with other parts of the language
in strange ways.

<p>The <code>setjmp</code> function is actually a macro without an actual
function definition, so you shouldn't try to <code>#undef</code> it or take
its address.  In addition, calls to <code>setjmp</code> are safe in only the
following contexts:

<ul>
<li>As the test expression of a selection or iteration
statement (such as <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code>, or <code>while</code>).

<li>As one operand of a equality or comparison operator that appears as the
test expression of a selection or iteration statement.  The other
operand must be an integer constant expression.

<li>As the operand of a unary <code>!</code> operator, that appears as the
test expression of a selection or iteration statement.

<li>By itself as an expression statement. 
</ul>

<p>Return points are valid only during the dynamic extent of the function
that called <code>setjmp</code> to establish them.  If you <code>longjmp</code> to
a return point that was established in a function that has already
returned, unpredictable and disastrous things are likely to happen.

<p>You should use a nonzero <var>value</var> argument to <code>longjmp</code>.  While
<code>longjmp</code> refuses to pass back a zero argument as the return value
from <code>setjmp</code>, this is intended as a safety net against accidental
misuse and is not really good programming style.

<p>When you perform a non-local exit, accessible objects generally retain
whatever values they had at the time <code>longjmp</code> was called.  The
exception is that the values of automatic variables local to the
function containing the <code>setjmp</code> call that have been changed since
the call to <code>setjmp</code> are indeterminate, unless you have declared
them <code>volatile</code>.
