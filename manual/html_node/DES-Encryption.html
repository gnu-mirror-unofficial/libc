<h3>DES Encryption</h3>

<p>The Data Encryption Standard is described in the US Government Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 46-3 published by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology.  The DES has been very thoroughly
analyzed since it was developed in the late 1970s, and no new
significant flaws have been found.

<p>However, the DES uses only a 56-bit key (plus 8 parity bits), and a
machine has been built in 1998 which can search through all possible
keys in about 6 days, which cost about US$200000; faster searches would
be possible with more money.  This makes simple DES insecure for most
purposes, and NIST no longer permits new US government systems
to use simple DES.

<p>For serious encryption functionality, it is recommended that one of the
many free encryption libraries be used instead of these routines.

<p>The DES is a reversible operation which takes a 64-bit block and a
64-bit key, and produces another 64-bit block.  Usually the bits are
numbered so that the most-significant bit, the first bit, of each block
is numbered 1.

<p>Under that numbering, every 8th bit of the key (the 8th, 16th, and so
on) is not used by the encryption algorithm itself.  But the key must
have odd parity; that is, out of bits 1 through 8, and 9 through 16, and
so on, there must be an odd number of `1' bits, and this completely
specifies the unused bits.

<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>

<p>The function <code>ecb_crypt</code> encrypts or decrypts one or more blocks
using DES.  Each block is encrypted independently.

<p>The <var>blocks</var> and the <var>key</var> are stored packed in 8-bit bytes, so
that the first bit of the key is the most-significant bit of
<code>key[0]</code> and the 63rd bit of the key is stored as the
least-significant bit of <code>key[7]</code>.  The <var>key</var> should have the
correct parity.

<p><var>len</var> is the number of bytes in <var>blocks</var>.  It should be a
multiple of 8 (so that there is a whole number of blocks to encrypt). 
<var>len</var> is limited to a maximum of <code>DES_MAXDATA</code> bytes.

<p>The result of the encryption replaces the input in <var>blocks</var>.

<p>The <var>mode</var> parameter is the bitwise OR of two of the following:

<dl>
<dt><code>DES_ENCRYPT</code>
<dd>This constant, used in the <var>mode</var> parameter, specifies that
<var>blocks</var> is to be encrypted.

<br><dt><code>DES_DECRYPT</code>
<dd>This constant, used in the <var>mode</var> parameter, specifies that
<var>blocks</var> is to be decrypted.

<br><dt><code>DES_HW</code>
<dd>This constant, used in the <var>mode</var> parameter, asks to use a hardware
device.  If no hardware device is available, encryption happens anyway,
but in software.

<br><dt><code>DES_SW</code>
<dd>This constant, used in the <var>mode</var> parameter, specifies that no
hardware device is to be used. 
</dl>

<p>The result of the function will be one of these values:

<dl>
<dt><code>DESERR_NONE</code>
<dd>The encryption succeeded.

<br><dt><code>DESERR_NOHWDEVICE</code>
<dd>The encryption succeeded, but there was no hardware device available.

<br><dt><code>DESERR_HWERROR</code>
<dd>The encryption failed because of a hardware problem.

<br><dt><code>DESERR_BADPARAM</code>
<dd>The encryption failed because of a bad parameter, for instance <var>len</var>
is not a multiple of 8 or <var>len</var> is larger than <code>DES_MAXDATA</code>.

<p>The function <code>cbc_crypt</code> encrypts or decrypts one or more blocks
using DES in Cipher Block Chaining mode.

<p>For encryption in CBC mode, each block is exclusive-ored with <var>ivec</var>
before being encrypted, then <var>ivec</var> is replaced with the result of
the encryption, then the next block is processed.  Decryption is the
reverse of this process.

<p>This has the advantage that blocks which are the same before being
encrypted are very unlikely to be the same after being encrypted, making
it much harder to detect patterns in the data.

<p>Usually, <var>ivec</var> is set to 8 random bytes before encryption starts. 
Then the 8 random bytes are transmitted along with the encrypted data
(without themselves being encrypted), and passed back in as <var>ivec</var>
for decryption.  Another possibility is to set <var>ivec</var> to 8 zeroes
initially, and have the first the block encrypted consist of 8 random
bytes.

<p>Otherwise, all the parameters are similar to those for <code>ecb_crypt</code>.
