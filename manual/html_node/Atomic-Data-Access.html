<h4>Atomic Data Access and Signal Handling</h4>

<p>Whether the data in your application concerns atoms, or mere text, you
have to be careful about the fact that access to a single datum is not
necessarily <dfn>atomic</dfn>.  This means that it can take more than one
instruction to read or write a single object.  In such cases, a signal
handler might be invoked in the middle of reading or writing the object.

<p>There are three ways you can cope with this problem.  You can use data
types that are always accessed atomically; you can carefully arrange
that nothing untoward happens if an access is interrupted, or you can
block all signals around any access that had better not be interrupted
(see <a href="Blocking-Signals.html#Blocking%20Signals">Blocking Signals</a>).
