<h4>Programs to handle message catalogs for <code>gettext</code></h4>

<p>The GNU C Library does not contain the source code for the programs to
handle message catalogs for the <code>gettext</code> functions.  As part of
the GNU project the GNU gettext package contains everything the
developer needs.  The functionality provided by the tools in this
package by far exceeds the abilities of the <code>gencat</code> program
described above for the <code>catgets</code> functions.

<p>There is a program <code>msgfmt</code> which is the equivalent program to the
<code>gencat</code> program.  It generates from the human-readable and
-editable form of the message catalog a binary file which can be used by
the <code>gettext</code> functions.  But there are several more programs
available.

<p>The <code>xgettext</code> program can be used to automatically extract the
translatable messages from a source file.  I.e., the programmer need not
take care for the translations and the list of messages which have to be
translated.  S/He will simply wrap the translatable string in calls to
<code>gettext</code> et.al and the rest will be done by <code>xgettext</code>.  This
program has a lot of option which help to customize the output or do
help to understand the input better.

<p>Other programs help to manage development cycle when new messages appear
in the source files or when a new translation of the messages appear. 
here it should only be noted that using all the tools in GNU gettext it
is possible to <em>completely</em> automize the handling of message
catalog.  Beside marking the translatable string in the source code and
generating the translations the developers do not have anything to do
themselves.
