<h4>ISO C</h4>

<p>The GNU C library is compatible with the C standard adopted by the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI):
<cite>American National Standard X3.159-1989--"ANSI C"</cite> and later
by the International Standardization Organization (ISO):
<cite>ISO/IEC 9899:1990, "Programming languages--C"</cite>. 
We here refer to the standard as ISO&nbsp;C since this is the more
general standard in respect of ratification. 
The header files and library facilities that make up the GNU library are
a superset of those specified by the ISO&nbsp;C standard.

<p>If you are concerned about strict adherence to the ISO&nbsp;C standard, you
should use the <code>-ansi</code> option when you compile your programs with
the GNU C compiler.  This tells the compiler to define <em>only</em> ISO
standard features from the library header files, unless you explicitly
ask for additional features.  See <a href="Feature-Test-Macros.html#Feature%20Test%20Macros">Feature Test Macros</a>, for
information on how to do this.

<p>Being able to restrict the library to include only ISO&nbsp;C features is
important because ISO&nbsp;C puts limitations on what names can be defined
by the library implementation, and the GNU extensions don't fit these
limitations.  See <a href="Reserved-Names.html#Reserved%20Names">Reserved Names</a>, for more information about these
restrictions.

<p>This manual does not attempt to give you complete details on the
differences between ISO&nbsp;C and older dialects.  It gives advice on how
to write programs to work portably under multiple C dialects, but does
not aim for completeness.
