<h5>Host Address Data Type</h5>

<p>IPv4 Internet host addresses are represented in some contexts as integers
(type <code>uint32_t</code>).  In other contexts, the integer is
packaged inside a structure of type <code>struct in_addr</code>.  It would
be better if the usage were made consistent, but it is not hard to extract
the integer from the structure or put the integer into a structure.

<p>You will find older code that uses <code>unsigned long int</code> for
IPv4 Internet host addresses instead of <code>uint32_t</code> or <code>struct
in_addr</code>.  Historically <code>unsigned long int</code> was a 32-bit number but
with 64-bit machines this has changed.  Using <code>unsigned long int</code>
might break the code if it is used on machines where this type doesn't
have 32 bits.  <code>uint32_t</code> is specified by Unix98 and guaranteed to have
32 bits.

<p>IPv6 Internet host addresses have 128 bits and are packaged inside a
structure of type <code>struct in6_addr</code>.

<p>The following basic definitions for Internet addresses are declared in
the header file <code>netinet/in.h</code>:

<p>
<table width="100%">

<td align="left"><b>struct in_addr</b><i>
</i></td>

</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
This data type is used in certain contexts to contain an IPv4 Internet
host address.  It has just one field, named <code>s_addr</code>, which records
the host address number as an <code>uint32_t</code>. 
</td></tr>

<td align="left">uint32_t <b>INADDR_LOOPBACK</b><i>

<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
You can use this constant to stand for "the address of this machine,"
instead of finding its actual address.  It is the IPv4 Internet address
<code>127.0.0.1</code>, which is usually called <code>localhost</code>.  This
special constant saves you the trouble of looking up the address of your
own machine.  Also, the system usually implements <code>INADDR_LOOPBACK</code>
specially, avoiding any network traffic for the case of one machine
talking to itself.

You can use this constant to stand for "any incoming address" when
binding to an address.  See <a href="Setting-Address.html#Setting%20Address">Setting Address</a>.  This is the usual
address to give in the <code>sin_addr</code> member of <code>struct&nbsp;sockaddr_in</code> when you want to accept Internet connections.
