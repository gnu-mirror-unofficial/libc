<h2>Debugging support</h2>

<p>Applications are usually debugged using dedicated debugger programs. 
But sometimes this is not possible and, in any case, it is useful to
provide the developer with as much information as possible at the time
the problems are experienced.  For this reason a few functions are
provided which a program can use to help the developer more easily
locate the problem.

<ul>
<li><a accesskey=1 href="Backtraces.html#Backtraces">Backtraces</a>:                 Obtaining and printing a back trace of the
                               current stack. 
</ul>
