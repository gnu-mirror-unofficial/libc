<h3>Running a Command</h3>

<p>The easy way to run another program is to use the <code>system</code>
function.  This function does all the work of running a subprogram, but
it doesn't give you much control over the details: you have to wait
until the subprogram terminates before you can do anything else.

This function executes <var>command</var> as a shell command.  In the GNU C
library, it always uses the default shell <code>sh</code> to run the command. 
In particular, it searches the directories in <code>PATH</code> to find
programs to execute.  The return value is <code>-1</code> if it wasn't
possible to create the shell process, and otherwise is the status of the
shell process.  See <a href="Process-Completion.html#Process%20Completion">Process Completion</a>, for details on how this
status code can be interpreted.

<p>If the <var>command</var> argument is a null pointer, a return value of zero
indicates that no command processor is available.

<p>This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.  This
is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like memory, file
descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time <code>system</code> is
called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources stay allocated
until the program ends.  To avoid this calls to <code>system</code> should be
protected using cancellation handlers.

<p>The <code>system</code> function is declared in the header file
<code>stdlib.h</code>.

<p><strong>Portability Note:</strong> Some C implementations may not have any
notion of a command processor that can execute other programs.  You can
determine whether a command processor exists by executing
<code>system&nbsp;(NULL)</code>; if the return value is nonzero, a command
processor is available.

<p>The <code>popen</code> and <code>pclose</code> functions (see <a href="Pipe-to-a-Subprocess.html#Pipe%20to%20a%20Subprocess">Pipe to a Subprocess</a>) are closely related to the <code>system</code> function.  They
allow the parent process to communicate with the standard input and
output channels of the command being executed.
