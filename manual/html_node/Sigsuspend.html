<h4>Using <code>sigsuspend</code></h4>

<p>The clean and reliable way to wait for a signal to arrive is to block it
and then use <code>sigsuspend</code>.  By using <code>sigsuspend</code> in a loop,
you can wait for certain kinds of signals, while letting other kinds of
signals be handled by their handlers.

<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left">int <b>sigsuspend</b><i> (const sigset_t *<var>set</var>)
</i></td>
<td align="right">Function</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
This function replaces the process's signal mask with <var>set</var> and then
suspends the process until a signal is delivered whose action is either
to terminate the process or invoke a signal handling function.  In other
words, the program is effectively suspended until one of the signals that
is not a member of <var>set</var> arrives.

<p>If the process is woken up by delivery of a signal that invokes a handler
function, and the handler function returns, then <code>sigsuspend</code> also
returns.

<p>The mask remains <var>set</var> only as long as <code>sigsuspend</code> is waiting. 
The function <code>sigsuspend</code> always restores the previous signal mask
when it returns.

<p>The return value and error conditions are the same as for <code>pause</code>. 
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>With <code>sigsuspend</code>, you can replace the <code>pause</code> or <code>sleep</code>
loop in the previous section with something completely reliable:

<br><pre>sigset_t mask, oldmask;

<small>...</small>

/* Set up the mask of signals to temporarily block. */
sigemptyset (&amp;mask);
sigaddset (&amp;mask, SIGUSR1);

<small>...</small>

/* Wait for a signal to arrive. */
sigprocmask (SIG_BLOCK, &amp;mask, &amp;oldmask);
while (!usr_interrupt)
  sigsuspend (&amp;oldmask);
sigprocmask (SIG_UNBLOCK, &amp;mask, NULL);
</pre>

<p>This last piece of code is a little tricky.  The key point to remember
here is that when <code>sigsuspend</code> returns, it resets the process's
signal mask to the original value, the value from before the call to
<code>sigsuspend</code>--in this case, the <code>SIGUSR1</code> signal is once
again blocked.  The second call to <code>sigprocmask</code> is
necessary to explicitly unblock this signal.

<p>One other point: you may be wondering why the <code>while</code> loop is
necessary at all, since the program is apparently only waiting for one
<code>SIGUSR1</code> signal.  The answer is that the mask passed to
<code>sigsuspend</code> permits the process to be woken up by the delivery of
other kinds of signals, as well--for example, job control signals.  If
the process is woken up by a signal that doesn't set
<code>usr_interrupt</code>, it just suspends itself again until the "right"
kind of signal eventually arrives.

<p>This technique takes a few more lines of preparation, but that is needed
just once for each kind of wait criterion you want to use.  The code
that actually waits is just four lines.
