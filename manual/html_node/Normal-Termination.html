<h4>Normal Termination</h4>

<p>A process terminates normally when its program signals it is done by
calling <code>exit</code>.  Returning from <code>main</code> is equivalent to
calling <code>exit</code>, and the value that <code>main</code> returns is used as
the argument to <code>exit</code>.

<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left">void <b>exit</b><i> (int <var>status</var>)
</i></td>
<td align="right">Function</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
The <code>exit</code> function tells the system that the program is done, which
causes it to terminate the process.

<p><var>status</var> is the program's exit status, which becomes part of the
process' termination status.  This function does not return. 
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Normal termination causes the following actions:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Functions that were registered with the <code>atexit</code> or <code>on_exit</code>
functions are called in the reverse order of their registration.  This
mechanism allows your application to specify its own "cleanup" actions
to be performed at program termination.  Typically, this is used to do
things like saving program state information in a file, or unlocking
locks in shared data bases.

<li>All open streams are closed, writing out any buffered output data.  See
<a href="Closing-Streams.html#Closing%20Streams">Closing Streams</a>.  In addition, temporary files opened
with the <code>tmpfile</code> function are removed; see <a href="Temporary-Files.html#Temporary%20Files">Temporary Files</a>.

<li><code>_exit</code> is called, terminating the program.  See <a href="Termination-Internals.html#Termination%20Internals">Termination Internals</a>.
</ol>
