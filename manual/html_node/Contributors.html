<!-- %MENU% Who wrote what parts of the GNU C library -->
<h2 class="appendix">Appendix E Contributors to the GNU C Library</h2>

<p>The GNU C library was written originally by Roland McGrath, and is
currently maintained by Ulrich Drepper.  Some parts of the library were
contributed or worked on by other people.

     <ul>
<li>The <code>getopt</code> function and related code was written by
Richard Stallman, David&nbsp;J.<!-- /@w --> MacKenzie, and Roland&nbsp;McGrath<!-- /@w -->.

     <li>The merge sort function <code>qsort</code> was written by Michael J. Haertel.

     <li>The quick sort function used as a fallback by <code>qsort</code> was written
by Douglas C. Schmidt.

     <li>The memory allocation functions <code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code> and
<code>free</code> and related code were written by Michael J. Haertel,
Wolfram&nbsp;Gloger<!-- /@w -->, and Doug&nbsp;Lea<!-- /@w -->.

     <li>Fast implementations of many of the string functions (<code>memcpy</code>,
<code>strlen</code>, etc.) were written by Torbj&ouml;rn Granlund.

     <li>The <samp><span class="file">tar.h</span></samp> header file was written by David J. MacKenzie.

     <li>The port to the MIPS DECStation running Ultrix 4
(<code>mips-dec-ultrix4</code>)
was contributed by Brendan Kehoe and Ian Lance Taylor.

     <li>The DES encryption function <code>crypt</code> and related functions were
contributed by Michael Glad.

     <li>The <code>ftw</code> and <code>nftw</code> functions were contributed by Ulrich Drepper.

     <li>The startup code to support SunOS shared libraries was contributed by
Tom Quinn.

     <li>The <code>mktime</code> function was contributed by Paul Eggert.

     <li>The port to the Sequent Symmetry running Dynix version 3
(<code>i386-sequent-bsd</code>) was contributed by Jason Merrill.

     <li>The timezone support code is derived from the public-domain timezone
package by Arthur David Olson and his many contributors.

     <li>The port to the DEC Alpha running OSF/1 (<code>alpha-dec-osf1</code>) was
contributed by Brendan Kehoe, using some code written by Roland McGrath.

     <li>The port to SGI machines running Irix 4 (<code>mips-sgi-irix4</code>) was
contributed by Tom Quinn.

     <li>The port of the Mach and Hurd code to the MIPS architecture
(<code>mips-</code><var>anything</var><code>-gnu</code>) was contributed by Kazumoto Kojima.

     <li>The floating-point printing function used by <code>printf</code> and friends
and the floating-point reading function used by <code>scanf</code>,
<code>strtod</code> and friends were written by Ulrich Drepper.  The
multi-precision integer functions used in those functions are taken from
GNU MP, which was contributed by Torbj&ouml;rn Granlund.

     <li>The internationalization support in the library, and the support
programs <code>locale</code> and <code>localedef</code>, were written by Ulrich
Drepper.  Ulrich Drepper adapted the support code for message catalogs
(<samp><span class="file">libintl.h</span></samp>, etc.) from the GNU <code>gettext</code> package, which he
also wrote.  He also contributed the <code>catgets</code> support and the
entire suite of multi-byte and wide-character support functions
(<samp><span class="file">wctype.h</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">wchar.h</span></samp>, etc.).

     <li>The implementations of the <samp><span class="file">nsswitch.conf</span></samp> mechanism and the files
and DNS backends for it were designed and written by Ulrich Drepper and
Roland McGrath, based on a backend interface defined by Peter Eriksson.

     <li>The port to Linux i386/ELF (<code>i386-</code><var>anything</var><code>-linux</code>) was
contributed by Ulrich Drepper, based in large part on work done in
Hongjiu Lu's Linux version of the GNU C Library.

     <li>The port to Linux/m68k (<code>m68k-</code><var>anything</var><code>-linux</code>) was
contributed by Andreas Schwab.

     <li>The ports to Linux/ARM (<code>arm-</code><var>ANYTHING</var><code>-linuxaout</code>) and ARM
standalone (<code>arm-</code><var>ANYTHING</var><code>-none</code>), as well as parts of the
IPv6 support code, were contributed by Philip Blundell.

     <li>Richard Henderson contributed the ELF dynamic linking code and other
support for the Alpha processor.

     <li>David Mosberger-Tang contributed the port to Linux/Alpha
(<code>alpha-</code><var>anything</var><code>-linux</code>).

     <li>The port to Linux on PowerPC (<code>powerpc-</code><var>anything</var><code>-linux</code>)
was contributed by Geoffrey Keating.

     <li>Miles Bader wrote the argp argument-parsing package, and the argz/envz
interfaces.

     <li>Stephen R. van den Berg contributed a highly-optimized <code>strstr</code> function.

     <li>Ulrich Drepper contributed the <code>hsearch</code> and <code>drand48</code>
families of functions; reentrant `<samp><span class="samp">...</span><code>_r</code></samp>' versions of the
<code>random</code> family; System V shared memory and IPC support code; and
several highly-optimized string functions for i<var>x</var>86 processors.

     <li>The math functions are taken from <code>fdlibm-5.1</code> by Sun
Microsystems, as modified by J.T. Conklin, Ian Lance Taylor,
Ulrich Drepper, Andreas Schwab, and Roland McGrath.

     <li>The <code>libio</code> library used to implement <code>stdio</code> functions on
some platforms was written by Per Bothner and modified by Ulrich Drepper.

     <li>Eric Youngdale and Ulrich Drepper implemented versioning of objects on
 symbol level.

     <li>Thorsten Kukuk provided an implementation for NIS (YP) and NIS+,
securelevel 0, 1 and 2.

     <li>Andreas Jaeger provided a test suite for the math library.

     <li>Mark Kettenis implemented the utmpx interface and an utmp daemon.

     <li>Ulrich Drepper added character conversion functions (<code>iconv</code>).

     <li>Thorsten Kukuk provided an implementation for a caching daemon for NSS
(nscd).

     <li>Tim Waugh provided an implementation of the POSIX.2 wordexp function family.

     <li>Mark Kettenis provided a Hesiod NSS module.

     <li>The Internet-related code (most of the <samp><span class="file">inet</span></samp> subdirectory) and
several other miscellaneous functions and header files have been
included from 4.4 BSD with little or no modification.

     <p>All code incorporated from 4.4 BSD is under the following copyright:

     <li>The random number generation functions <code>random</code>, <code>srandom</code>,
<code>setstate</code> and <code>initstate</code>, which are also the basis for the
<code>rand</code> and <code>srand</code> functions, were written by Earl T. Cohen
for the University of California at Berkeley and are copyrighted by the

changes to fit into the GNU C library and to fit the ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> standard,
