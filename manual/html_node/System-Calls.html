<h3>System Calls</h3>

<p>A system call is a request for service that a program makes of the
kernel.  The service is generally something that only the kernel has
the privilege to do, such as doing I/O.  Programmers don't normally
need to be concerned with system calls because there are functions in
the GNU C library to do virtually everything that system calls do. 
These functions work by making system calls themselves.  For example,
there is a system call that changes the permissions of a file, but
you don't need to know about it because you can just use the GNU C
library's <code>chmod</code> function.

<p>System calls are sometimes called kernel calls.

<p>However, there are times when you want to make a system call explicitly,
and for that, the GNU C library provides the <code>syscall</code> function. 
<code>syscall</code> is harder to use and less portable than functions like
<code>chmod</code>, but easier and more portable than coding the system call
in assembler instructions.

<p><code>syscall</code> is most useful when you are working with a system call
which is special to your system or is newer than the GNU C library you
are using.  <code>syscall</code> is implemented in an entirely generic way;
the function does not know anything about what a particular system
call does or even if it is valid.

<p>The description of <code>syscall</code> in this section assumes a certain
protocol for system calls on the various platforms on which the GNU C
library runs.  That protocol is not defined by any strong authority, but
we won't describe it here either because anyone who is coding
<code>syscall</code> probably won't accept anything less than kernel and C
library source code as a specification of the interface between them
anyway.

<p><code>syscall</code> is declared in <code>unistd.h</code>.

<p><code>syscall</code> performs a generic system call.

<p><var>sysno</var> is the system call number.  Each kind of system call is
identified by a number.  Macros for all the possible system call numbers
are defined in <code>sys/syscall.h</code>

<p>The remaining arguments are the arguments for the system call, in
order, and their meanings depend on the kind of system call.  Each kind
of system call has a definite number of arguments, from zero to five. 
If you code more arguments than the system call takes, the extra ones to
the right are ignored.

<p>The return value is the return value from the system call, unless the
system call failed.  In that case, <code>syscall</code> returns <code>-1</code> and
sets <code>errno</code> to an error code that the system call returned.  Note
that system calls do not return <code>-1</code> when they succeed.

<p>If you specify an invalid <var>sysno</var>, <code>syscall</code> returns <code>-1</code>
with <code>errno</code> = <code>ENOSYS</code>.

<p>Example:

<br><pre>
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;

...

int rc;

rc = syscall(SYS_chmod, "/etc/passwd", 0444);

if (rc == -1)
   fprintf(stderr, "chmod failed, errno = %d\n", errno);

</pre>

<p>This, if all the compatibility stars are aligned, is equivalent to the
following preferable code:

<br><pre>
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;

...

int rc;

rc = chmod("/etc/passwd", 0444);
if (rc == -1)
   fprintf(stderr, "chmod failed, errno = %d\n", errno);

</pre>
