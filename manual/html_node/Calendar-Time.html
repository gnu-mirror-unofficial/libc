<h3>Calendar Time</h3>

<p>This section describes facilities for keeping track of calendar time. 
See <a href="Time-Basics.html#Time%20Basics">Time Basics</a>.

<p>The GNU C library represents calendar time three ways:

<ul>
<li><dfn>Simple time</dfn> (the <code>time_t</code> data type) is a compact
representation, typically giving the number of seconds of elapsed time
since some implementation-specific base time.

<li>There is also a "high-resolution time" representation.  Like simple
time, this represents a calendar time as an elapsed time since a base
time, but instead of measuring in whole seconds, it uses a <code>struct
timeval</code> data type, which includes fractions of a second.  Use this time
representation instead of simple time when you need greater precision.

<li><dfn>Local time</dfn> or <dfn>broken-down time</dfn> (the <code>struct tm</code> data
type) represents a calendar time as a set of components specifying the
year, month, and so on in the Gregorian calendar, for a specific time
zone.  This calendar time representation is usually used only to
communicate with people.
