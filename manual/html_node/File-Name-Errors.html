<h4>File Name Errors</h4>

<p>Functions that accept file name arguments usually detect these
<code>errno</code> error conditions relating to the file name syntax or
trouble finding the named file.  These errors are referred to throughout
this manual as the <dfn>usual file name errors</dfn>.

<dl>
<dt><code>EACCES</code>
<dd>The process does not have search permission for a directory component
of the file name.

<br><dt><code>ENAMETOOLONG</code>
<dd>This error is used when either the total length of a file name is
greater than <code>PATH_MAX</code>, or when an individual file name component
has a length greater than <code>NAME_MAX</code>.  See <a href="Limits-for-Files.html#Limits%20for%20Files">Limits for Files</a>.

<p>In the GNU system, there is no imposed limit on overall file name
length, but some file systems may place limits on the length of a
component.

<br><dt><code>ENOENT</code>
<dd>This error is reported when a file referenced as a directory component
in the file name doesn't exist, or when a component is a symbolic link
whose target file does not exist.  See <a href="Symbolic-Links.html#Symbolic%20Links">Symbolic Links</a>.

<br><dt><code>ENOTDIR</code>
<dd>A file that is referenced as a directory component in the file name
exists, but it isn't a directory.

<br><dt><code>ELOOP</code>
<dd>Too many symbolic links were resolved while trying to look up the file
name.  The system has an arbitrary limit on the number of symbolic links
that may be resolved in looking up a single file name, as a primitive
way to detect loops.  See <a href="Symbolic-Links.html#Symbolic%20Links">Symbolic Links</a>.
