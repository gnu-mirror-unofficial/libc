<h5>Generic Numeric Formatting Parameters</h5>

<p>These are the standard members of <code>struct lconv</code>; there may be
others.

<dl>
<dt><code>char *decimal_point</code>
<dt><code>char *mon_decimal_point</code>
<dd>These are the decimal-point separators used in formatting non-monetary
and monetary quantities, respectively.  In the <code>C</code> locale, the
value of <code>decimal_point</code> is <code>"."</code>, and the value of
<code>mon_decimal_point</code> is <code>""</code>.

<br><dt><code>char *thousands_sep</code>
<dt><code>char *mon_thousands_sep</code>
<dd>These are the separators used to delimit groups of digits to the left of
the decimal point in formatting non-monetary and monetary quantities,
respectively.  In the <code>C</code> locale, both members have a value of
<code>""</code> (the empty string).

<br><dt><code>char *grouping</code>
<dt><code>char *mon_grouping</code>
<dd>These are strings that specify how to group the digits to the left of
the decimal point.  <code>grouping</code> applies to non-monetary quantities
and <code>mon_grouping</code> applies to monetary quantities.  Use either
<code>thousands_sep</code> or <code>mon_thousands_sep</code> to separate the digit
groups.

<p>Each member of these strings is to be interpreted as an integer value of
type <code>char</code>.  Successive numbers (from left to right) give the
sizes of successive groups (from right to left, starting at the decimal
point.)  The last member is either <code>0</code>, in which case the previous
member is used over and over again for all the remaining groups, or
<code>CHAR_MAX</code>, in which case there is no more grouping--or, put
another way, any remaining digits form one large group without
separators.

<p>For example, if <code>grouping</code> is <code>"\04\03\02"</code>, the correct
grouping for the number <code>123456787654321</code> is <code>12</code>, <code>34</code>,
<code>56</code>, <code>78</code>, <code>765</code>, <code>4321</code>.  This uses a group of 4
digits at the end, preceded by a group of 3 digits, preceded by groups
of 2 digits (as many as needed).  With a separator of <code>,</code>, the
number would be printed as <code>12,34,56,78,765,4321</code>.

<p>A value of <code>"\03"</code> indicates repeated groups of three digits, as
normally used in the U.S.

<p>In the standard <code>C</code> locale, both <code>grouping</code> and
<code>mon_grouping</code> have a value of <code>""</code>.  This value specifies no
grouping at all.

<br><dt><code>char int_frac_digits</code>
<dt><code>char frac_digits</code>
<dd>These are small integers indicating how many fractional digits (to the
right of the decimal point) should be displayed in a monetary value in
international and local formats, respectively.  (Most often, both
members have the same value.)

<p>In the standard <code>C</code> locale, both of these members have the value
<code>CHAR_MAX</code>, meaning "unspecified".  The ISO standard doesn't say
what to do when you find this value; we recommend printing no
fractional digits.  (This locale also specifies the empty string for
<code>mon_decimal_point</code>, so printing any fractional digits would be
confusing!)
