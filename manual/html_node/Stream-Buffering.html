<h3 class="section">Stream Buffering</h3>

<p>Characters that are written to a stream are normally accumulated and
transmitted asynchronously to the file in a block, instead of appearing
as soon as they are output by the application program.  Similarly,
streams often retrieve input from the host environment in blocks rather
than on a character-by-character basis.  This is called <dfn>buffering</dfn>.

   <p>If you are writing programs that do interactive input and output using
streams, you need to understand how buffering works when you design the
user interface to your program.  Otherwise, you might find that output
(such as progress or prompt messages) doesn't appear when you intended
it to, or displays some other unexpected behavior.

   <p>This section deals only with controlling when characters are transmitted
between the stream and the file or device, and <em>not</em> with how
things like echoing, flow control, and the like are handled on specific
classes of devices.  For information on common control operations on
terminal devices, see <a href="Low-Level-Terminal-Interface.html#Low-Level%20Terminal%20Interface">Low-Level Terminal Interface</a>.

   <p>You can bypass the stream buffering facilities altogether by using the
low-level input and output functions that operate on file descriptors
instead.  See <a href="Low-Level-I-O.html#Low-Level%20I%2fO">Low-Level I/O</a>.
