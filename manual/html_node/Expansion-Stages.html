<h4>The Stages of Word Expansion</h4>

<p>When word expansion is applied to a sequence of words, it performs the
following transformations in the order shown here:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li><dfn>Tilde expansion</dfn>: Replacement of <code>~foo</code> with the name of
the home directory of <code>foo</code>.

<li>Next, three different transformations are applied in the same step,
from left to right:

<ul>
<li><dfn>Variable substitution</dfn>: Environment variables are substituted for
references such as <code>$foo</code>.

<li><dfn>Command substitution</dfn>: Constructs such as <code>`cat&nbsp;foo`</code> and
the equivalent <code>$(cat&nbsp;foo)</code> are replaced with the output from
the inner command.

<li><dfn>Arithmetic expansion</dfn>: Constructs such as <code>$(($x-1))</code> are
replaced with the result of the arithmetic computation. 
</ul>

<li><dfn>Field splitting</dfn>: subdivision of the text into <dfn>words</dfn>.

<li><dfn>Wildcard expansion</dfn>: The replacement of a construct such as <code>*.c</code>
with a list of <code>.c</code> file names.  Wildcard expansion applies to an
entire word at a time, and replaces that word with 0 or more file names
that are themselves words.

<li><dfn>Quote removal</dfn>: The deletion of string-quotes, now that they have
done their job by inhibiting the above transformations when appropriate.
</ol>

<p>For the details of these transformations, and how to write the constructs
that use them, see <cite>The&nbsp;BASH&nbsp;Manual</cite> (to appear).
