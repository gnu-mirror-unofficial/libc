<h3>Standard Signals</h3>

<p>This section lists the names for various standard kinds of signals and
describes what kind of event they mean.  Each signal name is a macro
which stands for a positive integer--the <dfn>signal number</dfn> for that
kind of signal.  Your programs should never make assumptions about the
numeric code for a particular kind of signal, but rather refer to them
always by the names defined here.  This is because the number for a
given kind of signal can vary from system to system, but the meanings of
the names are standardized and fairly uniform.

<p>The signal names are defined in the header file <code>signal.h</code>.

The value of this symbolic constant is the total number of signals
defined.  Since the signal numbers are allocated consecutively,
<code>NSIG</code> is also one greater than the largest defined signal number.
