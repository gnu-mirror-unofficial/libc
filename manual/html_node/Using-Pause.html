<h4>Using <code>pause</code></h4>

<p>The simple way to wait until a signal arrives is to call <code>pause</code>. 
Please read about its disadvantages, in the following section, before
you use it.

<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left">int <b>pause</b><i> ()
</i></td>
<td align="right">Function</td>

<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
The <code>pause</code> function suspends program execution until a signal
arrives whose action is either to execute a handler function, or to
terminate the process.

<p>If the signal causes a handler function to be executed, then
<code>pause</code> returns.  This is considered an unsuccessful return (since
"successful" behavior would be to suspend the program forever), so the
return value is <code>-1</code>.  Even if you specify that other primitives
should resume when a system handler returns (see <a href="Interrupted-Primitives.html#Interrupted%20Primitives">Interrupted Primitives</a>), this has no effect on <code>pause</code>; it always fails when a
signal is handled.

<p>The following <code>errno</code> error conditions are defined for this function:

<dl>
<dt><code>EINTR</code>
<dd>The function was interrupted by delivery of a signal. 
</dl>

<p>If the signal causes program termination, <code>pause</code> doesn't return
(obviously).

<p>This function is a cancellation point in multithreaded programs.  This
is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like memory, file
descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time <code>pause</code> is
called.  If the thread gets cancelled these resources stay allocated
until the program ends.  To avoid this calls to <code>pause</code> should be
protected using cancellation handlers.

<p>The <code>pause</code> function is declared in  <code>unistd.h</code>.
