<h3>Pseudo-Terminals</h3>

<p>A <dfn>pseudo-terminal</dfn> is a special interprocess communication channel
that acts like a terminal.  One end of the channel is called the
<dfn>master</dfn> side or <dfn>master pseudo-terminal device</dfn>, the other side
is called the <dfn>slave</dfn> side.  Data written to the master side is
received by the slave side as if it was the result of a user typing at
an ordinary terminal, and data written to the slave side is sent to the
master side as if it was written on an ordinary terminal.

<p>Pseudo terminals are the way programs like <code>xterm</code> and <code>emacs</code>
implement their terminal emulation functionality.
