<h5>Atomic Types</h5>

<p>To avoid uncertainty about interrupting access to a variable, you can
use a particular data type for which access is always atomic:
<code>sig_atomic_t</code>.  Reading and writing this data type is guaranteed
to happen in a single instruction, so there's no way for a handler to
run "in the middle" of an access.

<p>The type <code>sig_atomic_t</code> is always an integer data type, but which
one it is, and how many bits it contains, may vary from machine to
machine.

<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left"><b>sig_atomic_t</b><i>
</i></td>
<td align="right">Data Type</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
This is an integer data type.  Objects of this type are always accessed
atomically. 
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In practice, you can assume that <code>int</code> and other integer types no
longer than <code>int</code> are atomic.  You can also assume that pointer
types are atomic; that is very convenient.  Both of these assumptions
are true on all of the machines that the GNU C library supports and on
all POSIX systems we know of.
