<h5>Efficiency Considerations for <code>malloc</code></h5>

<p>As opposed to other versions, the <code>malloc</code> in the GNU C Library
does not round up block sizes to powers of two, neither for large nor
for small sizes.  Neighboring chunks can be coalesced on a <code>free</code>
no matter what their size is.  This makes the implementation suitable
for all kinds of allocation patterns without generally incurring high
memory waste through fragmentation.

<p>Very large blocks (much larger than a page) are allocated with
<code>mmap</code> (anonymous or via <code>/dev/zero</code>) by this implementation. 
This has the great advantage that these chunks are returned to the
system immediately when they are freed.  Therefore, it cannot happen
that a large chunk becomes "locked" in between smaller ones and even
after calling <code>free</code> wastes memory.  The size threshold for
<code>mmap</code> to be used can be adjusted with <code>mallopt</code>.  The use of
<code>mmap</code> can also be disabled completely.
