<h3 class="subsection">String Input Conversions</h4>

<p>This section describes the <code>scanf</code> input conversions for reading
string and character values: <code>%s</code>, <code>%S</code>, <code>%[</code>, <code>%c</code>,
and <code>%C</code>.

   <p>You have two options for how to receive the input from these
conversions:

     <ul>
<li>Provide a buffer to store it in.  This is the default.  You should
provide an argument of type <code>char *</code> or <code>wchar_t *</code> (the
latter of the <code>l</code> modifier is present).

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> To make a robust program, you must make sure that the
input (plus its terminating null) cannot possibly exceed the size of the
buffer you provide.  In general, the only way to do this is to specify a
maximum field width one less than the buffer size.  <strong>If you
provide the buffer, always specify a maximum field width to prevent
overflow.</strong>

     <li>Ask <code>scanf</code> to allocate a big enough buffer, by specifying the
<code>a</code> flag character.  This is a GNU extension.  You should provide
an argument of type <code>char **</code> for the buffer address to be stored
in.  See <a href="Dynamic-String-Input.html#Dynamic%20String%20Input">Dynamic String Input</a>. 
</ul>

   <p>The <code>%c</code> conversion is the simplest: it matches a fixed number of
characters, always.  The maximum field width says how many characters to
read; if you don't specify the maximum, the default is 1.  This
conversion doesn't append a null character to the end of the text it
reads.  It also does not skip over initial whitespace characters.  It
reads precisely the next <var>n</var> characters, and fails if it cannot get
that many.  Since there is always a maximum field width with <code>%c</code>
(whether specified, or 1 by default), you can always prevent overflow by
making the buffer long enough.

   <p>If the format is <code>%lc</code> or <code>%C</code> the function stores wide
characters which are converted using the conversion determined at the
time the stream was opened from the external byte stream.  The number of
bytes read from the medium is limited by <code>MB_CUR_LEN * </code><var>n</var><code></code> but
at most <var>n</var> wide character get stored in the output string.

   <p>The <code>%s</code> conversion matches a string of non-whitespace characters. 
It skips and discards initial whitespace, but stops when it encounters
more whitespace after having read something.  It stores a null character
at the end of the text that it reads.

   <p>For example, reading the input:

<pre class="smallexample">      hello, world
     </pre>

<p>with the conversion <code>%10c</code> produces <code>" hello, wo"</code>, but
reading the same input with the conversion <code>%10s</code> produces
<code>"hello,"</code>.

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you do not specify a field width for <code>%s</code>,
then the number of characters read is limited only by where the next
whitespace character appears.  This almost certainly means that invalid
input can make your program crash--which is a bug.

   <p>The <code>%ls</code> and <code>%S</code> format are handled just like <code>%s</code>
except that the external byte sequence is converted using the conversion
associated with the stream to wide characters with their own encoding. 
A width or precision specified with the format do not directly determine
how many bytes are read from the stream since they measure wide
characters.  But an upper limit can be computed by multiplying the value
of the width or precision by <code>MB_CUR_MAX</code>.

   <p>To read in characters that belong to an arbitrary set of your choice,
use the <code>%[</code> conversion.  You specify the set between the <code>[</code>
character and a following <code>]</code> character, using the same syntax used
in regular expressions.  As special cases:

     <ul>
<li>A literal <code>]</code> character can be specified as the first character
of the set.

     <li>An embedded <code>-</code> character (that is, one that is not the first or
last character of the set) is used to specify a range of characters.

     <li>If a caret character <code>^</code> immediately follows the initial <code>[</code>,
then the set of allowed input characters is the everything <em>except</em>
the characters listed. 
</ul>

   <p>The <code>%[</code> conversion does not skip over initial whitespace
characters.

   <p>Here are some examples of <code>%[</code> conversions and what they mean:

     <dl>
<dt><code>%25[1234567890]</code>
     <dd>Matches a string of up to 25 digits.

     <br><dt><code>%25[][]</code>
     <dd>Matches a string of up to 25 square brackets.

     <br><dt><code>%25[^ \f\n\r\t\v]</code>
     <dd>Matches a string up to 25 characters long that doesn't contain any of
the standard whitespace characters.  This is slightly different from
<code>%s</code>, because if the input begins with a whitespace character,
<code>%[</code> reports a matching failure while <code>%s</code> simply discards the
initial whitespace.

     <br><dt><code>%25[a-z]</code>
     <dd>Matches up to 25 lowercase characters. 
</dl>

   <p>As for <code>%c</code> and <code>%s</code> the <code>%[</code> format is also modified to
produce wide characters if the <code>l</code> modifier is present.  All what
is said about <code>%ls</code> above is true for <code>%l[</code>.

   <p>One more reminder: the <code>%s</code> and <code>%[</code> conversions are
<strong>dangerous</strong> if you don't specify a maximum width or use the
<code>a</code> flag, because input too long would overflow whatever buffer you
have provided for it.  No matter how long your buffer is, a user could
supply input that is longer.  A well-written program reports invalid
input with a comprehensible error message, not with a crash.
