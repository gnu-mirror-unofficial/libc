<h3>Trivial Encryption</h3>

<p>The <code>memfrob</code> function converts an array of data to something
unrecognizable and back again.  It is not encryption in its usual sense
since it is easy for someone to convert the encrypted data back to clear
text.  The transformation is analogous to Usenet's "Rot13" encryption
method for obscuring offensive jokes from sensitive eyes and such. 
Unlike Rot13, <code>memfrob</code> works on arbitrary binary data, not just
text.

<p>For true encryption, See <a href="Cryptographic-Functions.html#Cryptographic%20Functions">Cryptographic Functions</a>.

<p>This function is declared in <code>string.h</code>.

<p><code>memfrob</code> transforms (frobnicates) each byte of the data structure
at <var>mem</var>, which is <var>length</var> bytes long, by bitwise exclusive
oring it with binary 00101010.  It does the transformation in place and
its return value is always <var>mem</var>.

<p>Note that <code>memfrob</code> a second time on the same data structure
returns it to its original state.

<p>This is a good function for hiding information from someone who doesn't
want to see it or doesn't want to see it very much.  To really prevent
people from retrieving the information, use stronger encryption such as
that described in See <a href="Cryptographic-Functions.html#Cryptographic%20Functions">Cryptographic Functions</a>.

<p><strong>Portability Note:</strong>  This function is unique to the GNU C library.
