<h3 class="section">Threads and Fork</h3>

<p>It's not intuitively obvious what should happen when a multi-threaded POSIX
process calls <code>fork</code>. Not only are the semantics tricky, but you may
need to write code that does the right thing at fork time even if that code
doesn't use the <code>fork</code> function. Moreover, you need to be aware of
interaction between <code>fork</code> and some library features like
<code>pthread_once</code> and stdio streams.

   <p>When <code>fork</code> is called by one of the threads of a process, it creates a new
process which is copy of the  calling process. Effectively, in addition to
copying certain system objects, the function takes a snapshot of the memory
areas of the parent process, and creates identical areas in the child. 
To make matters more complicated, with threads it's possible for two or more
threads to concurrently call fork to create two or more child processes.

   <p>The child process has a copy of the address space of the parent, but it does
not inherit any of its threads. Execution of the child process is carried out
by a new thread which returns from <code>fork</code> function with a return value of
zero; it is the only thread in the child process.  Because threads are not
inherited across fork, issues arise. At the time of the call to <code>fork</code>,
threads in the parent process other than the one calling <code>fork</code> may have
been executing critical regions of code.  As a result, the child process may
get a copy of objects that are not in a well-defined state.  This potential
problem affects all components of the program.

   <p>Any program component which will continue being used in a child process must
correctly handle its state during <code>fork</code>. For this purpose, the POSIX
interface provides the special function <code>pthread_atfork</code> for installing
pointers to handler functions which are called from within <code>fork</code>.

<table width="95%" align="center">

     <p><code>pthread_atfork</code> registers handler functions to be called just
before and just after a new process is created with <code>fork</code>. The
<var>prepare</var> handler will be called from the parent process, just
before the new process is created. The <var>parent</var> handler will be
called from the parent process, just before <code>fork</code> returns. The
<var>child</var> handler will be called from the child process, just before
<code>fork</code> returns.

     <p><code>pthread_atfork</code> returns 0 on success and a non-zero error code on
error.

     <p>One or more of the three handlers <var>prepare</var>, <var>parent</var> and
<var>child</var> can be given as <code>NULL</code>, meaning that no handler needs
to be called at the corresponding point.

     <p><code>pthread_atfork</code> can be called several times to install several
sets of handlers. At <code>fork</code> time, the <var>prepare</var> handlers are
called in LIFO order (last added with <code>pthread_atfork</code>, first
called before <code>fork</code>), while the <var>parent</var> and <var>child</var>
handlers are called in FIFO order (first added, first called).

     <p>If there is insufficient memory available to register the handlers,
<code>pthread_atfork</code> fails and returns <code>ENOMEM</code>.  Otherwise it
returns 0.

     <p>The functions <code>fork</code> and <code>pthread_atfork</code> must not be regarded as
reentrant from the context of the handlers.  That is to say, if a
<code>pthread_atfork</code> handler invoked from within <code>fork</code> calls
<code>pthread_atfork</code> or <code>fork</code>, the behavior is undefined.

     <p>Registering a triplet of handlers is an atomic operation with respect to fork. 
If new handlers are registered at about the same time as a fork occurs, either
all three handlers will be called, or none of them will be called.

     <p>The handlers are inherited by the child process, and there is no
way to remove them, short of using <code>exec</code> to load a new
pocess image.

        </td></tr>

   <p>To understand the purpose of <code>pthread_atfork</code>, recall that
<code>fork</code> duplicates the whole memory space, including mutexes in
their current locking state, but only the calling thread: other threads
are not running in the child process.  The mutexes are not usable after
the <code>fork</code> and must be initialized with <code>pthread_mutex_init</code>
in the child process.  This is a limitation of the current
implementation and might or might not be present in future versions.

   <p>To avoid this, install handlers with <code>pthread_atfork</code> as follows: have the
<var>prepare</var> handler lock the mutexes (in locking order), and the
<var>parent</var> handler unlock the mutexes. The <var>child</var> handler should reset
the mutexes using <code>pthread_mutex_init</code>, as well as any other
synchronization objects such as condition variables.

   <p>Locking the global mutexes before the fork ensures that all other threads are
locked out of the critical regions of code protected by those mutexes.  Thus
when <code>fork</code> takes a snapshot of the parent's address space, that snapshot
will copy valid, stable data.  Resetting the synchronization objects in the
child process will ensure they are properly cleansed of any artifacts from the
threading subsystem of the parent process. For example, a mutex may inherit
a wait queue of threads waiting for the lock; this wait queue makes no sense
in the child process. Initializing the mutex takes care of this.
