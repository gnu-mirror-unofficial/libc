<h3>Rounding Modes</h3>

<p>Floating-point calculations are carried out internally with extra
precision, and then rounded to fit into the destination type.  This
ensures that results are as precise as the input data.  IEEE&nbsp;754
defines four possible rounding modes:

<dl>
<dt>Round to nearest.
<dd>This is the default mode.  It should be used unless there is a specific
need for one of the others.  In this mode results are rounded to the
nearest representable value.  If the result is midway between two
representable values, the even representable is chosen. <dfn>Even</dfn> here
means the lowest-order bit is zero.  This rounding mode prevents
statistical bias and guarantees numeric stability: round-off errors in a
lengthy calculation will remain smaller than half of <code>FLT_EPSILON</code>.

<br><dt>Round toward plus Infinity.
<dd>All results are rounded to the smallest representable value
which is greater than the result.

<br><dt>Round toward minus Infinity.
<dd>All results are rounded to the largest representable value which is less
than the result.

<br><dt>Round toward zero.
<dd>All results are rounded to the largest representable value whose
magnitude is less than that of the result.  In other words, if the
result is negative it is rounded up; if it is positive, it is rounded
down. 
</dl>

<p><code>fenv.h</code> defines constants which you can use to refer to the
various rounding modes.  Each one will be defined if and only if the FPU
supports the corresponding rounding mode.

<dl>
<dt><code>FE_TONEAREST</code>
<dd>Round to nearest.

<br><dt><code>FE_UPWARD</code>
<dd>Round toward +&amp;infin;.

<br><dt><code>FE_DOWNWARD</code>
<dd>Round toward -&amp;infin;.

<br><dt><code>FE_TOWARDZERO</code>
<dd>Round toward zero. 
</dl>

<p>Underflow is an unusual case.  Normally, IEEE&nbsp;754 floating point
numbers are always normalized (see <a href="Floating-Point-Concepts.html#Floating%20Point%20Concepts">Floating Point Concepts</a>). 
Numbers smaller than 2^r (where r is the minimum exponent,
<code>FLT_MIN_RADIX-1</code> for <var>float</var>) cannot be represented as
normalized numbers.  Rounding all such numbers to zero or 2^r
would cause some algorithms to fail at 0.  Therefore, they are left in
denormalized form.  That produces loss of precision, since some bits of
the mantissa are stolen to indicate the decimal point.

<p>If a result is too small to be represented as a denormalized number, it
is rounded to zero.  However, the sign of the result is preserved; if
the calculation was negative, the result is <dfn>negative zero</dfn>. 
Negative zero can also result from some operations on infinity, such as
4/-&amp;infin;.  Negative zero behaves identically to zero except
when the <code>copysign</code> or <code>signbit</code> functions are used to check
the sign bit directly.

<p>At any time one of the above four rounding modes is selected.  You can
find out which one with this function:

<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left">int <b>fegetround</b><i> (void)
</i></td>
<td align="right">Function</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
Returns the currently selected rounding mode, represented by one of the
values of the defined rounding mode macros. 
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To change the rounding mode, use this function:

<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left">int <b>fesetround</b><i> (int <var>round</var>)
</i></td>
<td align="right">Function</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
Changes the currently selected rounding mode to <var>round</var>.  If
<var>round</var> does not correspond to one of the supported rounding modes
nothing is changed.  <code>fesetround</code> returns zero if it changed the
rounding mode, a nonzero value if the mode is not supported. 
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You should avoid changing the rounding mode if possible.  It can be an
expensive operation; also, some hardware requires you to compile your
program differently for it to work.  The resulting code may run slower. 
See your compiler documentation for details.
