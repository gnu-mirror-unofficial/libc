<h4>Process Signal Mask</h4>

<p>The collection of signals that are currently blocked is called the
<dfn>signal mask</dfn>.  Each process has its own signal mask.  When you
create a new process (see <a href="Creating-a-Process.html#Creating%20a%20Process">Creating a Process</a>), it inherits its
parent's mask.  You can block or unblock signals with total flexibility
by modifying the signal mask.

<p>The prototype for the <code>sigprocmask</code> function is in <code>signal.h</code>.

The <code>sigprocmask</code> function is used to examine or change the calling
process's signal mask.  The <var>how</var> argument determines how the signal
mask is changed, and must be one of the following values:

<dl>
<dt><code>SIG_BLOCK</code>
<dd>Block the signals in <code>set</code>--add them to the existing mask.  In
other words, the new mask is the union of the existing mask and
<var>set</var>.

<br><dt><code>SIG_UNBLOCK</code>
<dd>Unblock the signals in <var>set</var>--remove them from the existing mask.

<br><dt><code>SIG_SETMASK</code>
<dd>Use <var>set</var> for the mask; ignore the previous value of the mask. 
</dl>

<p>The last argument, <var>oldset</var>, is used to return information about the
old process signal mask.  If you just want to change the mask without
looking at it, pass a null pointer as the <var>oldset</var> argument. 
Similarly, if you want to know what's in the mask without changing it,
pass a null pointer for <var>set</var> (in this case the <var>how</var> argument
is not significant).  The <var>oldset</var> argument is often used to
remember the previous signal mask in order to restore it later.  (Since
the signal mask is inherited over <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code> calls, you
can't predict what its contents are when your program starts running.)

<p>If invoking <code>sigprocmask</code> causes any pending signals to be
unblocked, at least one of those signals is delivered to the process
before <code>sigprocmask</code> returns.  The order in which pending signals
are delivered is not specified, but you can control the order explicitly
by making multiple <code>sigprocmask</code> calls to unblock various signals
one at a time.

<p>The <code>sigprocmask</code> function returns <code>0</code> if successful, and <code>-1</code>
to indicate an error.  The following <code>errno</code> error conditions are
defined for this function:

<dl>
<dt><code>EINVAL</code>
<dd>The <var>how</var> argument is invalid. 
</dl>

<p>You can't block the <code>SIGKILL</code> and <code>SIGSTOP</code> signals, but
if the signal set includes these, <code>sigprocmask</code> just ignores
them instead of returning an error status.

<p>Remember, too, that blocking program error signals such as <code>SIGFPE</code>
leads to undesirable results for signals generated by an actual program
error (as opposed to signals sent with <code>raise</code> or <code>kill</code>). 
This is because your program may be too broken to be able to continue
executing to a point where the signal is unblocked again.
