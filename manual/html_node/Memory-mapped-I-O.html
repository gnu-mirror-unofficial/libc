<h3 class="section">Memory-mapped I/O</h3>

<p>On modern operating systems, it is possible to <dfn>mmap</dfn> (pronounced
"em-map") a file to a region of memory.  When this is done, the file can
be accessed just like an array in the program.

   <p>This is more efficient than <code>read</code> or <code>write</code>, as only the regions
of the file that a program actually accesses are loaded.  Accesses to
not-yet-loaded parts of the mmapped region are handled in the same way as
swapped out pages.

   <p>Since mmapped pages can be stored back to their file when physical
memory is low, it is possible to mmap files orders of magnitude larger
than both the physical memory <em>and</em> swap space.  The only limit is
address space.  The theoretical limit is 4GB on a 32-bit machine -
however, the actual limit will be smaller since some areas will be
reserved for other purposes.  If the LFS interface is used the file size
on 32-bit systems is not limited to 2GB (offsets are signed which
reduces the addressable area of 4GB by half); the full 64-bit are
available.

   <p>Memory mapping only works on entire pages of memory.  Thus, addresses
for mapping must be page-aligned, and length values will be rounded up. 
To determine the size of a page the machine uses one should use

<pre class="smallexample">     size_t page_size = (size_t) sysconf (_SC_PAGESIZE);
     </pre>

<p>These functions are declared in <code>sys/mman.h</code>.

     <p>The <code>mmap</code> function creates a new mapping, connected to bytes
(<var>offset</var>) to (<var>offset</var> + <var>length</var> - 1) in the file open on
<var>filedes</var>.  A new reference for the file specified by <var>filedes</var>
is created, which is not removed by closing the file.

     <p><var>address</var> gives a preferred starting address for the mapping. 
<code>NULL</code> expresses no preference. Any previous mapping at that
address is automatically removed. The address you give may still be
changed, unless you use the <code>MAP_FIXED</code> flag.

     <p><var>protect</var> contains flags that control what kind of access is
permitted.  They include <code>PROT_READ</code>, <code>PROT_WRITE</code>, and
<code>PROT_EXEC</code>, which permit reading, writing, and execution,
respectively.  Inappropriate access will cause a segfault (see <a href="Program-Error-Signals.html#Program%20Error%20Signals">Program Error Signals</a>).

     <p>Note that most hardware designs cannot support write permission without
read permission, and many do not distinguish read and execute permission. 
Thus, you may receive wider permissions than you ask for, and mappings of
write-only files may be denied even if you do not use <code>PROT_READ</code>.

     <p><var>flags</var> contains flags that control the nature of the map. 
One of <code>MAP_SHARED</code> or <code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> must be specified.

     <p>They include:

          <dl>
<dt><code>MAP_PRIVATE</code>
          <dd>This specifies that writes to the region should never be written back
to the attached file.  Instead, a copy is made for the process, and the
region will be swapped normally if memory runs low.  No other process will
see the changes.

          <p>Since private mappings effectively revert to ordinary memory
when written to, you must have enough virtual memory for a copy of
the entire mmapped region if you use this mode with <code>PROT_WRITE</code>.

          <br><dt><code>MAP_SHARED</code>
          <dd>This specifies that writes to the region will be written back to the
file.  Changes made will be shared immediately with other processes
mmaping the same file.

          <p>Note that actual writing may take place at any time.  You need to use
<code>msync</code>, described below, if it is important that other processes
using conventional I/O get a consistent view of the file.

          <br><dt><code>MAP_FIXED</code>
          <dd>This forces the system to use the exact mapping address specified in
<var>address</var> and fail if it can't.

          <br><dt><code>MAP_ANONYMOUS</code>
          <dd><dt><code>MAP_ANON</code>
          <dd>This flag tells the system to create an anonymous mapping, not connected
to a file.  <var>filedes</var> and <var>off</var> are ignored, and the region is
initialized with zeros.

          <p>Anonymous maps are used as the basic primitive to extend the heap on some
systems.  They are also useful to share data between multiple tasks
without creating a file.

          <p>On some systems using private anonymous mmaps is more efficient than using
<code>malloc</code> for large blocks.  This is not an issue with the GNU C library,
as the included <code>malloc</code> automatically uses <code>mmap</code> where appropriate.

     </dl>

     <p><code>mmap</code> returns the address of the new mapping, or -1 for an
error.

     <p>Possible errors include:

          <dl>

          <br><dt><code>EINVAL</code>
          <dd>
Either <var>address</var> was unusable, or inconsistent <var>flags</var> were
given.

          <br><dt><code>EACCES</code>
          <dd>
<var>filedes</var> was not open for the type of access specified in <var>protect</var>.

          <br><dt><code>ENOMEM</code>
          <dd>
Either there is not enough memory for the operation, or the process is
out of address space.

          <br><dt><code>ENODEV</code>
          <dd>
This file is of a type that doesn't support mapping.

          <br><dt><code>ENOEXEC</code>
          <dd>
The file is on a filesystem that doesn't support mapping.

The <code>mmap64</code> function is equivalent to the <code>mmap</code> function but
the <var>offset</var> parameter is of type <code>off64_t</code>.  On 32-bit systems
this allows the file associated with the <var>filedes</var> descriptor to be
larger than 2GB.  <var>filedes</var> must be a descriptor returned from a

     <p><code>munmap</code> removes any memory maps from (<var>addr</var>) to (<var>addr</var> +

     <p>It is safe to unmap multiple mappings in one command, or include unmapped
space in the range.  It is also possible to unmap only part of an existing
mapping.  However, only entire pages can be removed.  If <var>length</var> is not
an even number of pages, it will be rounded up.

     <p>When using shared mappings, the kernel can write the file at any time
before the mapping is removed.  To be certain data has actually been
written to the file and will be accessible to non-memory-mapped I/O, it
is necessary to use this function.

     <p>It operates on the region <var>address</var> to (<var>address</var> + <var>length</var>). 
It may be used on part of a mapping or multiple mappings, however the

          <br><dt><code>MS_SYNC</code>

This flag makes sure the data is actually written <em>to disk</em>. 
Normally <code>msync</code> only makes sure that accesses to a file with
conventional I/O reflect the recent changes.

          <br><dt><code>MS_ASYNC</code>
          <dd>
This tells <code>msync</code> to begin the synchronization, but not to wait for
it to complete.

   <p>This function is only available on a few systems.  Except for performing
optional optimizations one should not rely on this function.

   <p>Not all file descriptors may be mapped.  Sockets, pipes, and most devices
only allow sequential access and do not fit into the mapping abstraction. 
In addition, some regular files may not be mmapable, and older kernels may
not support mapping at all.  Thus, programs using <code>mmap</code> should
have a fallback method to use should it fail. See <a href="../standards/Mmap.html#Mmap">Mmap</a>.
