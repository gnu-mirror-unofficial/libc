<h3>File Attributes</h3>

<p>When you issue an <code>ls -l</code> shell command on a file, it gives you
information about the size of the file, who owns it, when it was last
modified, etc.  These are called the <dfn>file attributes</dfn>, and are
associated with the file itself and not a particular one of its names.

<p>This section contains information about how you can inquire about and
modify the attributes of a file.
