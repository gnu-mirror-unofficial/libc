<h3 class="appendixsec">C.1 Configuring and compiling GNU Libc</h3>

<p><a name="index-configuring-3790"></a><a name="index-compiling-3791"></a>
GNU libc can be compiled in the source directory, but we strongly advise to
build it in a separate build directory.  For example, if you have unpacked
the glibc sources in <samp><span class="file">/src/gnu/glibc-2.2.0</span></samp>, create a directory
<samp><span class="file">/src/gnu/glibc-build</span></samp> to put the object files in.  This allows
removing the whole build directory in case an error occurs, which is the
safest way to get a fresh start and should always be done.

   <p>From your object directory, run the shell script <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> found
at the top level of the source tree.  In the scenario above, you'd type

<pre class="smallexample">     $ ../glibc-2.2.0/configure <var>args...</var>
</pre>
   <p>Please note that even if you're building in a separate build directory,
the compilation needs to modify a few files in the source
directory, especially some files in the manual subdirectory.

<p class="noindent"><code>configure</code> takes many options, but you can get away with knowing
only two: `<samp><span class="samp">--prefix</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">--enable-add-ons</span></samp>'.  The
<code>--prefix</code> option tells configure where you want glibc installed. 
This defaults to <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>.  The `<samp><span class="samp">--enable-add-ons</span></samp>' option
tells configure to use all the add-on bundles it finds in the source
directory.  Since important functionality is provided in add-ons, you
should always specify this option.

   <p>It may also be useful to set the <var>CC</var> and <var>CFLAGS</var> variables in
the environment when running <code>configure</code>.  <var>CC</var> selects the C
compiler that will be used, and <var>CFLAGS</var> sets optimization options
for the compiler.

   <p>The following list describes all of the available options for <code>configure</code>:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--prefix=</span><var>directory</var></samp>'<dd>Install machine-independent data files in subdirectories of
<samp><var>directory</var></samp>.  The default is to install in <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--exec-prefix=</span><var>directory</var></samp>'<dd>Install the library and other machine-dependent files in subdirectories
of <samp><var>directory</var></samp>.  The default is to the `<samp><span class="samp">--prefix</span></samp>'
directory if that option is specified, or <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> otherwise.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--with-headers=</span><var>directory</var></samp>'<dd>Look for kernel header files in <var>directory</var>, not
<samp><span class="file">/usr/include</span></samp>.  Glibc needs information from the kernel's private
header files.  It will normally look in <samp><span class="file">/usr/include</span></samp> for them,
but if you specify this option, it will look in <var>DIRECTORY</var> instead.

     <p>This option is primarily of use on a system where the headers in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/include</span></samp> come from an older version of glibc.  Conflicts can
occasionally happen in this case.  Note that Linux libc5 qualifies as an
older version of glibc.  You can also use this option if you want to
compile glibc with a newer set of kernel headers than the ones found in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/include</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--enable-add-ons[=</span><var>list</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>'<dd>Enable add-on packages in your source tree.  If this option is specified
with no list, it enables all the add-on packages it finds.  If you do
not wish to use some add-on package that you have present in your source
tree, give this option a list of the add-ons that you <em>do</em> want
used, like this: `<samp><span class="samp">--enable-add-ons=linuxthreads</span></samp>'

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--enable-kernel=</span><var>version</var></samp>'<dd>This option is currently only useful on Linux systems.  The
<var>version</var> parameter should have the form X.Y.Z and describes the
smallest version of the Linux kernel the generated library is expected
to support.  The higher the <var>version</var> number is, the less
compatibility code is added, and the faster the code gets.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--with-binutils=</span><var>directory</var></samp>'<dd>Use the binutils (assembler and linker) in <samp><var>directory</var></samp>, not
the ones the C compiler would default to.  You could use this option if
the default binutils on your system cannot deal with all the constructs
in the GNU C library.  In that case, <code>configure</code> will detect the problem and
suppress these constructs, so that the library will still be usable, but
functionality may be lost&mdash;for example, you can't build a shared libc
with old binutils.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--without-fp</span></samp>'<dd>Use this option if your computer lacks hardware floating-point support
and your operating system does not emulate an FPU.

     <!-- disable static doesn't work currently -->
<!-- @item -disable-static -->
<!-- Don't build static libraries.  Static libraries aren't that useful these -->
<!-- days, but we recommend you build them in case you need them. -->
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--disable-shared</span></samp>'<dd>Don't build shared libraries even if it is possible.  Not all systems support
shared libraries; you need ELF support and (currently) the GNU linker.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--disable-profile</span></samp>'<dd>Don't build libraries with profiling information.  You may want to use
this option if you don't plan to do profiling.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--enable-omitfp</span></samp>'<dd>Use maximum optimization for the normal (static and shared)
libraries, and compile separate static libraries with debugging
information and no optimization.  We recommend against this.  The extra
optimization doesn't gain you much, it may provoke compiler bugs, and
you won't be able to trace bugs through the C library.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--disable-versioning</span></samp>'<dd>Don't compile the shared libraries with symbol version information. 
Doing this will make the resulting library incompatible with old
binaries, so it's not recommended.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--enable-static-nss</span></samp>'<dd>Compile static versions of the NSS (Name Service Switch) libraries. 
This is not recommended because it defeats the purpose of NSS; a program
linked statically with the NSS libraries cannot be dynamically
reconfigured to use a different name database.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--build=</span><var>build-system</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--host=</span><var>host-system</var></samp>'<dd>These options are for cross-compiling.  If you specify both options and
<var>build-system</var> is different from <var>host-system</var>, <code>configure</code>
will prepare to cross-compile glibc from <var>build-system</var> to be used
on <var>host-system</var>.  You'll probably need the `<samp><span class="samp">--with-headers</span></samp>'
option too, and you may have to override <var>configure</var>'s selection of
the compiler and/or binutils.

     <p>If you only specify `<samp><span class="samp">--host</span></samp>', configure will prepare for a native
compile but use what you specify instead of guessing what your system is. 
This is most useful to change the CPU submodel.  For example, if
configure guesses your machine as <code>i586-pc-linux-gnu</code> but you want
to compile a library for 386es, give `<samp><span class="samp">--host=i386-pc-linux-gnu</span></samp>' or
just `<samp><span class="samp">--host=i386-linux</span></samp>' and add the appropriate compiler flags
(`<samp><span class="samp">-mcpu=i386</span></samp>' will do the trick) to <var>CFLAGS</var>.

     <p>If you specify just `<samp><span class="samp">--build</span></samp>', configure will get confused. 
</dl>

   <p>To build the library and related programs, type <code>make</code>.  This will
produce a lot of output, some of which may look like errors from
<code>make</code> but isn't.  Look for error messages from <code>make</code>
containing `<samp><span class="samp">***</span></samp>'.  Those indicate that something is really wrong.

   <p>The compilation process takes several hours even on fast hardware. 
Expect at least two hours for the default configuration on i586 for
Linux.  For Hurd times are much longer.  Except for EGCS 1.1 and GCC
2.95 (and later versions of GCC), all supported versions of GCC have a
problem which causes them to take several minutes to compile certain
files in the iconvdata directory.  Do not panic if the compiler appears
to hang.

   <p>If you want to run a parallel make, you can't just give <code>make</code> the
`<samp><span class="samp">-j</span></samp>' option, because it won't be passed down to the sub-makes. 
Instead, edit the generated <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> and uncomment the line

<pre class="smallexample">     # PARALLELMFLAGS = -j 4
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can change the `<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>' to some other number as appropriate for
your system.  Instead of changing the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>, you could give
this option directly to <code>make</code> and call it as, for example,
<code>make PARALLELMFLAGS=-j4</code>.  If you're building in the source
directory, you must use the latter approach since in this case no
new <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> is generated for you to change.

   <p>To build and run test programs which exercise some of the library
facilities, type <code>make check</code>.  If it does not complete
successfully, do not use the built library, and report a bug after
verifying that the problem is not already known.  See <a href="Reporting-Bugs.html#Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>,
for instructions on reporting bugs.  Note that some of the tests assume
they are not being run by <code>root</code>.  We recommend you compile and
test glibc as an unprivileged user.

   <p>To format the <cite>GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite> for printing, type
<code>make&nbsp;dvi</code><!-- /@w -->.  You need a working TeX installation to do this. 
The distribution already includes the on-line formatted version of the
manual, as Info files.  You can regenerate those with <code>make&nbsp;info</code><!-- /@w -->, but it shouldn't be necessary.

   <p>The library has a number of special-purpose configuration parameters
which you can find in <samp><span class="file">Makeconfig</span></samp>.  These can be overwritten with
the file <samp><span class="file">configparms</span></samp>.  To change them, create a
<samp><span class="file">configparms</span></samp> in your build directory and add values as appropriate
for your system.  The file is included and parsed by <code>make</code> and has
to follow the conventions for makefiles.

   <p>It is easy to configure the GNU C library for cross-compilation by
setting a few variables in <samp><span class="file">configparms</span></samp>.  Set <code>CC</code> to the
cross-compiler for the target you configured the library for; it is
important to use this same <code>CC</code> value when running
<code>configure</code>, like this: `<samp><span class="samp">CC=</span><var>target</var><span class="samp">-gcc configure
</span><var>target</var></samp>'.  Set <code>BUILD_CC</code> to the compiler to use for for
programs run on the build system as part of compiling the library.  You
may need to set <code>AR</code> and <code>RANLIB</code> to cross-compiling versions
of <code>ar</code> and <code>ranlib</code> if the native tools are not configured to
work with object files for the target you configured for.
