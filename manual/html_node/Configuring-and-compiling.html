<h3 class="appendixsec">Configuring and compiling GNU Libc</h3>

<p>GNU libc can be compiled in the source directory, but we strongly advise
building it in a separate build directory.  For example, if you have
 unpacked
the glibc sources in <code>/src/gnu/glibc-2.3</code>, create a directory
<code>/src/gnu/glibc-build</code> to put the object files in.  This allows
removing the whole build directory in case an error occurs, which is the
safest way to get a fresh start and should always be done.

   <p>From your object directory, run the shell script <code>configure</code> located
at the top level of the source tree.  In the scenario above, you'd type

<pre class="smallexample">     $ ../glibc-2.3/configure <var>args<small class="dots">...</small></var>
     </pre>

   <p>Please note that even if you're building in a separate build directory,
the compilation needs to modify a few files in the source
directory, especially some files in the manual subdirectory.

<p><code>configure</code> takes many options, but you can get away with knowing
only two: <code>--prefix</code> and <code>--enable-add-ons</code>.  The
<code>--prefix</code> option tells <code>configure</code> where you want glibc
installed. This defaults to <code>/usr/local</code>.  The
<code>--enable-add-ons</code> option tells <code>configure</code> to use all the
add-on bundles it finds in the source directory.  Since important
functionality is provided in add-ons, you should always specify this
option.

   <p>It may also be useful to set the <var>CC</var> and <var>CFLAGS</var> variables in
the environment when running <code>configure</code>.  <var>CC</var> selects the C
compiler that will be used, and <var>CFLAGS</var> sets optimization options
for the compiler.

   <p>The following list describes all of the available options for
 <code>configure</code>:

     <dl>
<dt><code>--prefix=</code><var>directory</var><code></code>
     <dd>Install machine-independent data files in subdirectories of
<code></code><var>directory</var><code></code>.  The default is to install in <code>/usr/local</code>.

     <br><dt><code>--exec-prefix=</code><var>directory</var><code></code>
     <dd>Install the library and other machine-dependent files in subdirectories
of <code></code><var>directory</var><code></code>.  The default is to the <code>--prefix</code>
directory if that option is specified, or <code>/usr/local</code> otherwise.

     <br><dt><code>--with-headers=</code><var>directory</var><code></code>
     <dd>Look for kernel header files in <var>directory</var>, not
<code>/usr/include</code>.  Glibc needs information from the kernel's private
header files.  Glibc will normally look in <code>/usr/include</code> for them,
but if you specify this option, it will look in <var>DIRECTORY</var> instead.

     <p>This option is primarily of use on a system where the headers in
<code>/usr/include</code> come from an older version of glibc.  Conflicts can
occasionally happen in this case.  Note that Linux libc5 qualifies as an
older version of glibc.  You can also use this option if you want to
compile glibc with a newer set of kernel headers than the ones found in
<code>/usr/include</code>.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-add-ons[=</code><var>list</var><code>]</code>
     <dd>Enable add-on packages in your source tree.  If this option is specified
with no list, it enables all the add-on packages it finds.  If you do
not wish to use some add-on packages that you have present in your source
tree, give this option a list of the add-ons that you <em>do</em> want
used, like this: <code>--enable-add-ons=linuxthreads</code>

     <br><dt><code>--enable-kernel=</code><var>version</var><code></code>
     <dd>This option is currently only useful on GNU/Linux systems.  The
<var>version</var> parameter should have the form X.Y.Z and describes the
smallest version of the Linux kernel the generated library is expected
to support.  The higher the <var>version</var> number is, the less
compatibility code is added, and the faster the code gets.

     <br><dt><code>--with-binutils=</code><var>directory</var><code></code>
     <dd>Use the binutils (assembler and linker) in <code></code><var>directory</var><code></code>, not
the ones the C compiler would default to.  You can use this option if
the default binutils on your system cannot deal with all the constructs
in the GNU C library.  In that case, <code>configure</code> will detect the
problem and suppress these constructs, so that the library will still be
usable, but functionality may be lost--for example, you can't build a
shared libc with old binutils.

     <br><dt><code>--without-fp</code>
     <dd>Use this option if your computer lacks hardware floating-point support
and your operating system does not emulate an FPU.

     <p>these

     <br><dt><code>--disable-shared</code>
     <dd>Don't build shared libraries even if it is possible.  Not all systems
support shared libraries; you need ELF support and (currently) the GNU
linker.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-profile</code>
     <dd>Don't build libraries with profiling information.  You may want to use
this option if you don't plan to do profiling.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-omitfp</code>
     <dd>Use maximum optimization for the normal (static and shared)
libraries, and compile separate static libraries with debugging
information and no optimization.  We recommend not doing this.  The extra
optimization doesn't gain you much, it may provoke compiler bugs, and you
won't be able to trace bugs through the C library.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-versioning</code>
     <dd>Don't compile the shared libraries with symbol version information. 
Doing this will make the resulting library incompatible with old
binaries, so it's not recommended.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-static-nss</code>
     <dd>Compile static versions of the NSS (Name Service Switch) libraries. 
This is not recommended because it defeats the purpose of NSS; a program
linked statically with the NSS libraries cannot be dynamically
reconfigured to use a different name database.

     <br><dt><code>--without-tls</code>
     <dd>By default the C library is built with support for thread-local storage
if the used tools support it.  By using <code>--without-tls</code> this can be
prevented though there generally is no reason since it creates
compatibility problems.

     <br><dt><code>--build=</code><var>build-system</var><code></code>
     <dd><dt><code>--host=</code><var>host-system</var><code></code>
     <dd>These options are for cross-compiling.  If you specify both options and
<var>build-system</var> is different from <var>host-system</var>, <code>configure</code>
will prepare to cross-compile glibc from <var>build-system</var> to be used
on <var>host-system</var>.  You'll probably need the <code>--with-headers</code>
option too, and you may have to override <var>configure</var>'s selection of
the compiler and/or binutils.

     <p>If you only specify <code>--host</code>, <code>configure</code> will prepare for a
native compile but use what you specify instead of guessing what your
system is. This is most useful to change the CPU submodel.  For example,
if <code>configure</code> guesses your machine as <code>i586-pc-linux-gnu</code> but
you want to compile a library for 386es, give
<code>--host=i386-pc-linux-gnu</code> or just <code>--host=i386-linux</code> and add
the appropriate compiler flags (<code>-mcpu=i386</code> will do the trick) to
<var>CFLAGS</var>.

     <p>If you specify just <code>--build</code>, <code>configure</code> will get confused. 
</dl>

   <p>To build the library and related programs, type <code>make</code>.  This will
produce a lot of output, some of which may look like errors from
<code>make</code> but isn't.  Look for error messages from <code>make</code>
containing <code>***</code>.  Those indicate that something is seriously wrong.

   <p>The compilation process can take several hours.  Expect at least two
hours for the default configuration on i586 for GNU/Linux.  For Hurd,
times are much longer.  Some complex modules may take a very long time
to compile, as much as several minutes on slower machines.  Do not
panic if the compiler appears to hang.

   <p>If you want to run a parallel make, simply pass the <code>-j</code> option
with an appropriate numeric parameter to <code>make</code>.  You need a recent
GNU <code>make</code> version, though.

   <p>To build and run test programs which exercise some of the library
facilities, type <code>make check</code>.  If it does not complete
successfully, do not use the built library, and report a bug after
verifying that the problem is not already known.  See <a href="Reporting-Bugs.html#Reporting%20Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>,
for instructions on reporting bugs.  Note that some of the tests assume
they are not being run by <code>root</code>.  We recommend you compile and
test glibc as an unprivileged user.

   <p>Before reporting bugs make sure there is no problem with your system. 
The tests (and later installation) use some pre-existing files of the
system such as <code>/etc/passwd</code>, <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code> and others. 
These files must all contain correct and sensible content.

   <p>To format the <cite>GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite> for printing, type
<code>make&nbsp;dvi</code>.  You need a working TeX installation to do this. 
The distribution already includes the on-line formatted version of the
manual, as Info files.  You can regenerate those with <code>make&nbsp;info</code>, but it shouldn't be necessary.

   <p>The library has a number of special-purpose configuration parameters
which you can find in <code>Makeconfig</code>.  These can be overwritten with
the file <code>configparms</code>.  To change them, create a
<code>configparms</code> in your build directory and add values as appropriate
for your system.  The file is included and parsed by <code>make</code> and has
to follow the conventions for makefiles.

   <p>It is easy to configure the GNU C library for cross-compilation by
setting a few variables in <code>configparms</code>.  Set <code>CC</code> to the
cross-compiler for the target you configured the library for; it is
important to use this same <code>CC</code> value when running
<code>configure</code>, like this: <code>CC=</code><var>target</var><code>-gcc configure
</code><var>target</var><code></code>.  Set <code>BUILD_CC</code> to the compiler to use for programs
run on the build system as part of compiling the library.  You may need to
set <code>AR</code> and <code>RANLIB</code> to cross-compiling versions of <code>ar</code>
and <code>ranlib</code> if the native tools are not configured to work with
object files for the target you configured for.
