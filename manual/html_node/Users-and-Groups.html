<h2>Users and Groups</h2>

<p>Every user who can log in on the system is identified by a unique number
called the <dfn>user ID</dfn>.  Each process has an effective user ID which
says which user's access permissions it has.

<p>Users are classified into <dfn>groups</dfn> for access control purposes.  Each
process has one or more <dfn>group ID values</dfn> which say which groups the
process can use for access to files.

<p>The effective user and group IDs of a process collectively form its
<dfn>persona</dfn>.  This determines which files the process can access. 
Normally, a process inherits its persona from the parent process, but
under special circumstances a process can change its persona and thus
change its access permissions.

<p>Each file in the system also has a user ID and a group ID.  Access
control works by comparing the user and group IDs of the file with those
of the running process.

<p>The system keeps a database of all the registered users, and another
database of all the defined groups.  There are library functions you
can use to examine these databases.
