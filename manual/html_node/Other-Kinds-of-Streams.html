<h3>Other Kinds of Streams</h3>

<p>The GNU library provides ways for you to define additional kinds of
streams that do not necessarily correspond to an open file.

<p>One such type of stream takes input from or writes output to a string. 
These kinds of streams are used internally to implement the
<code>sprintf</code> and <code>sscanf</code> functions.  You can also create such a
stream explicitly, using the functions described in <a href="String-Streams.html#String%20Streams">String Streams</a>.

<p>More generally, you can define streams that do input/output to arbitrary
objects using functions supplied by your program.  This protocol is
discussed in <a href="Custom-Streams.html#Custom%20Streams">Custom Streams</a>.

<p><strong>Portability Note:</strong> The facilities described in this section are
specific to GNU.  Other systems or C implementations might or might not
provide equivalent functionality.

<ul>
<li><a accesskey=1 href="String-Streams.html#String%20Streams">String Streams</a>:               Streams that get data from or put data in
                                 a string or memory buffer. 
<li><a accesskey=2 href="Obstack-Streams.html#Obstack%20Streams">Obstack Streams</a>: 		Streams that store data in an obstack. 
<li><a accesskey=3 href="Custom-Streams.html#Custom%20Streams">Custom Streams</a>:               Defining your own streams with an arbitrary
                                 input data source and/or output data sink. 
</ul>
