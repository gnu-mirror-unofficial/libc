<h4><code>inetd</code> Servers</h4>

<p>Writing a server program to be run by <code>inetd</code> is very simple.  Each time
someone requests a connection to the appropriate port, a new server
process starts.  The connection already exists at this time; the
socket is available as the standard input descriptor and as the
standard output descriptor (descriptors 0 and 1) in the server
process.  Thus the server program can begin reading and writing data
right away.  Often the program needs only the ordinary I/O facilities;
in fact, a general-purpose filter program that knows nothing about
sockets can work as a byte stream server run by <code>inetd</code>.

<p>You can also use <code>inetd</code> for servers that use connectionless
communication styles.  For these servers, <code>inetd</code> does not try to accept
a connection since no connection is possible.  It just starts the
server program, which can read the incoming datagram packet from
descriptor 0.  The server program can handle one request and then
exit, or you can choose to write it to keep reading more requests
until no more arrive, and then exit.  You must specify which of these
two techniques the server uses when you configure <code>inetd</code>.
